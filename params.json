{"name":"Lifestudyofmatthew","tagline":"","body":"Welcome to Life Study of Matthew\r\n\r\nTHE EXPANSION OF CHRIST\r\nThe book of Acts is the expansion of this wonderful Person. It is the branching out of the all-inclusive Christ. This Christ has expanded from one Person to thousands and thousands of persons. He was once the individual Christ, but in Acts He has become a corporate Christ. Following the Acts, we have all the Epistles, which give a full definition of this wonderful, universal, great Man. Christ is the Head, and the church is the Body: this is the universal Man, Christ and the church. Finally, we have the book of Revelation as the consummation of the New Testament. This book gives us a full picture of the Body-Christ, the individual Christ incorporated with all His members to become the New Jerusalem.\r\nTHE ORDER OF THE FOUR GOSPELS\r\nLet us return to the four Gospels. If I were to arrange the four Gospels, I would put the Gospel of John first. When reading the Bible, many Christians start with John and then proceed to read Luke, Mark, and Matthew. The human concept is the exact opposite of the divine. The divine concept starts with Matthew and proceeds through John; the human thought starts with John and goes back to Matthew. Many of us would begin reading the New Testament with John because John is so wonderful. It is a book of life. After John, we would read Luke because Luke is a book of the Savior, telling us of many cases of salvation. Then, of course, we would come to Mark because Mark is short and simple. People read Matthew last because Matthew is too difficult, too mysterious. Not only is chapter one difficult to understand; the parables in chapter thirteen and the prophecies in chapters twenty-four and twenty-five are also difficult. Chapters five, six, and seven, the Sermon on the Mount, are especially difficult. No one can practice it! You strike me on the right cheek, and I turn to you the left. You force me to walk one mile, and I walk two miles. You take my outer garment, and I give you my inner garment. This is too much! Only Jesus can do it! Thus, many place Matthew last. John is dear and precious. In John, Jesus is everything, and we do not need to do anything. Hence, we like John, but not Matthew. We may not say this in plain words, but we have such a feeling in our heart. Nevertheless, the divine order is best. God put Matthew first.\r\nTHE GENERAL SKETCH\r\nWith every book of the Bible we need a general sketch. The general sketch of Matthew is:\r\nChrist is Jehovah God incarnated to be the King-Savior who came to establish the kingdom of the heavens (the heavenly rule) by saving His people from sin (of rebellion) through His death and resurrection.\r\nTHE CENTRAL THOUGHT\r\nWith every book of the Bible we also need to find the central thought. The central thought of Matthew is:\r\nChrist, as Jesus (Jehovah the Savior) and Emmanuel (God with us), is the King, the Baptizer, the light, the Teacher, the Healer, the Forgiver, the Bridegroom, the Shepherd, the Friend, the wisdom, the rest, the greater temple, the real David, the Lord of the Sabbath, the greater Jonah, the greater Solomon, the Sower, the seed, the Feeder, the bread, the crumbs under the table, the Christ, the Son of the living God, the rock for the church, the Builder of the church, the Founder of the kingdom, the present Moses, the present Elijah, the Head of the corner, the Lord, the resurrected One, the One with authority, and the One ever-present to His people in resurrection.\r\nHow rich Christ is in the book of Matthew, even richer than in John. As Jesus and Emmanuel He is another thirty-three items to us. We must enjoy Him and partake of Him. We need to experience Him in all these aspects in resurrection, not in the natural state. He is the ever-present One. Matthew begins with “God with us” and ends with “Lo, I am with you all the days, even unto the completion of the age.” How wonderful this is!\r\n\r\n3. The Civilians (the Captured Ones\r\nand the Recovered Ones)\r\nThe generation of Christ not only includes the highranking people, but also the civilians, the insignificant ones, like Mary and Joseph. The poor people, the little people, are also included in the generation of Christ. Christ was ranked not only with the patriarchs and with the kings, but also with a group of civilians. He was not only of the great ones, of the royal ones, but also of the little ones. From this picture of the generation of Christ, we can see that it includes all kinds of people.\r\nThis generation includes both the called ones, like Abraham, and the ones carried away to captivity. In this brief record we have the words “carrying away” (v. 17). Abraham was called out of Babel, the origin of Babylon. The generation of Christ includes not only the called ones, but also the backsliders. Perhaps five years ago you were a called one, but today you are a backslider. Do not be disappointed. The generation of Christ includes you. This generation includes Jeconiah, a king who was dethroned and carried away to Babylon as a captive. Have you ever been dethroned? Do not think you have not. In your Christian life you sometimes have been dethroned. Once you were a king, but you lost your kingship and became a backslider. Our forefather Abraham came from Babylon; yet you went back, not willingly, but were carried back. Praise the Lord that the generation of Christ includes even the fallen ones!\r\nAfter captivity there was the recovery. Hence, we have another name, Zerubbabel, the name of recovery. Many captives returned with Zerubbabel. The generation of Christ includes all kinds of people: good ones, bad ones, called ones, fallen ones, and recovered ones. If I were to ask you which kind you are, you may say that firstly you were a called one, then a fallen one, and finally a recovered one. You were an Abraham, you became a Jeconiah, but today you are a Zerubbabel. We are all Zerubbabels. We are the called ones, the fallen ones, and the recovered ones.\r\n\r\n 4. The Four Remarried Women\r\nAccording to Jewish custom, a writer of a genealogy would never include a female name; he would include only the names of males. But in this brief genealogy five women are mentioned. These five women are like the fingers of my hand: four form one group and the other one stands alone. Four of these five women were remarried, and one of the four was a harlot. It seems that the divine record here would not mention the good ones, such as Sarah or Rebekah, but the bad ones. Listen to the divine record: “David begot Solomon of the wife of Uriah” (1:6). The record does not even give her name; it gives only her history in order to remind us of what kind of person she was.\r\nDo you know the history of Tamar? She was the daughter-in-law of Judah. Judah begot twins of his daughter-in-law (Gen. 38:24-30). How terrible! The second woman named is Rahab, the harlot of Jericho, and the third, Ruth, a Moabitess. The Moabites were not allowed to enter the congregation of the Lord even to their tenth generation (Deut. 23:3). The Moabites are descendants of Moab, who was born of Lot with his daughter. The fourth woman was Bathsheba, the wife of a Canaanite named Uriah whom David murdered. David took her to be his wife, and with her he begot Solomon.\r\nWhy does this brief record mention all these women? It is because they are our representatives. Do not think you are so pure, that you are more pure than these women. Trace your own origin. If you do, you will find out by what way and of whom your grandfather was born, by what way and of whom your father was born, and by what way and of whom you were born. We are worse. But the worst ones are included in the generation of Christ! Praise the Lord! He is truly the Savior of sinners.\r\nThe number four signifies all the creatures, including the entire human race. Humanity is dirty; no one is clean. But, thank the Lord, we are all associated with Christ. We are part of the generation of Christ.\r\nIf we were to write a biography of Christ and there were no biographies of Him in the Bible, we would not dare to write it this way. We would hide all these impure grandmothers and give the names of the good grandmothers, such as Sarah and Rebekah. But the Holy Spirit did not mention Sarah, Rebekah, and all the good ones; however, He purposely included these impure ones. If this divine record had listed the names of the good women without the names of the impure ones, I would be in doubt about the present situation of the church. I would say, “Look at today’s situation in the church. Not many are very pure.” Do not think that you are so pure, so clean. We are not pure. Nevertheless, the generation of Christ includes both good ones and bad ones. In fact, it includes more bad ones than good ones.\r\n5. The One Virgin\r\nBesides the four remarried women, a virgin stands out: Mary, the mother of Jesus. Mary was good, pure, and clean. This indicates that everyone mentioned in this book of generation is a sinner except Jesus. With the exception of Jesus, all are unclean.\r\nB. The Son of David\r\nChrist is the son of David (Matt. 22:42, 45; Rev. 22:16). Solomon, the son of David, was a type of Christ in three main aspects. First, he was a type of Christ inheriting the kingdom (2 Sam. 7:12b, 13; Jer. 23:5; Luke 1:32-33). Second, Solomon had wisdom and spoke the word of wisdom. In Matthew 12 we see that Christ also had wisdom and spoke the word of wisdom. In this chapter Christ referred to Himself as the greater Solomon (v. 42). A greater than Solomon was there, and He spoke words of wisdom. No human words are as wise as the words of Christ. Third, Solomon built the temple of God (2 Sam. 7:13). As the son of David, Christ builds up God’s temple, the church.\r\nC. The Son of Abraham\r\nChrist is also the son of Abraham. This book of generation says only that Christ is the son of David and the son of Abraham, not the son of any one else. In the Old Testament there was a clear prophecy that Christ would be the son of Abraham. Isaac was a type of Christ. With Isaac as a type of Christ there were also three main aspects. First, Isaac brought the blessing to all nations, both Jews and Gentiles (Gen. 22:18a; Gal. 3:16, 14). Second, he was offered to God unto death and was resurrected (Gen. 22:1-12; Heb. 11:17, 19). Third, he received the bride (Gen. 24:67). This is a type of Christ as the promised One who brought the blessing to all nations, who was also offered to death, who was resurrected, and who, after His resurrection, will receive His Bride (John 3:29; Rev. 19:7). One day the Holy Spirit, typified by Abraham’s servant, will bring the spiritual, divine, heavenly Rebekah to her heavenly Isaac.\r\nThe son of Abraham received the bride, and the son of David built up the temple. With Christ, the Bride is the temple, and the temple is the Bride. This is why it says that Christ is the son of Abraham and the son of David. He offered Himself unto death and was resurrected, now He is building God’s temple, and in the future He will receive the Bride. Christ also spoke wisdom and brought God’s blessing to all nations. He is the One to fulfill all of these things. In the four Gospels we can find each of these six aspects. The Gospels reveal that Christ came to inherit the kingdom, that He offered Himself unto death and He was resurrected, that He spoke the word of wisdom, that He brought blessing to all people, that He is building up God’s house, and that He will come to receive the Bride. Christ is surely the real Isaac and the real Solomon.\r\nAs the son of David, Jesus was a great blessing to the Jews. But as the son of Abraham, He brings blessing to all the Gentiles. As the son of David, He is for the Jews; as the son of Abraham, He is for us all. If Jesus were only the son of David, He would have nothing to do with me. Praise the Lord that He is also the son of Abraham! All nations are blessed in Abraham’s seed, which is Christ. This blessing is the participation in the Triune God. The blessing which God promised to Abraham was the Spirit (Gal. 3:14), and the Spirit is the ultimate realization of the Triune God. By Christ as the son of Abraham, we have the Spirit, and we share in the Triune God. Hallelujah!\r\n\r\nAs far as you are concerned, which title has the better meaning—the kingdom of Israel or the kingdom of Judah? I would surely favor the kingdom of Israel, for that is something universal, something for the majority. I would never favor Judah, because Judah is too local, too narrow. However, although the kingdom of Israel was more universal than that of Judah, in the genealogy of Christ, not one name of the kings of Israel is included. They were universal, but they were excluded from the generation of Christ. They were excluded because they were not associated with Christ.\r\nThis picture, like all other items in the Old Testament, was written for our learning, and it is a type of the occurrences in the New Testament age. We see the same thing today. In principle, at the beginning the church was one. But after a certain time, the church was divided, not into two parts, but perhaps into more than two thousand parts. Some may say, “Were not those in the kingdom of Israel still the people of God?” Certainly they were. They were the people of God, but they were outside of the line of Christ. What does this mean? To be outside of the line of Christ means that, although you are God’s people, you are not for Christ. You are for something other than Christ. Consider the situation today. We are all real Christians, and we are all God’s people. But are we solely, purely, fully, and ultimately for Christ or are we for something else? If you are for something other than Christ, then you are outside of the line of Christ. For this reason, none of the kings of the northern kingdom, the larger and more universal kingdom, is included in the genealogy of Christ.\r\n\r\nR. David the King Begetting Solomon\r\nMatthew 1:6 says, “David begot Solomon.” Compare this statement with the record that says, “Nathan, the son of David” (Luke 3:31). Nathan also was the son of David. The genealogy in Matthew says that the son of David was Solomon, and the genealogy in Luke says that the son of David was Nathan. If we read 1 Chronicles 3:1 and 5, we see that these are two different persons. Luke’s record is the genealogy of David’s son Nathan, who was Mary’s forefather, whereas Matthew’s record is the genealogy of David’s son Solomon, who was Joseph’s forefather. One genealogy is the line of Mary, the wife’s line; the other genealogy is the line of Joseph, the husband’s line. Both Mary and Joseph were descendants of David, but they were from two families descended from the same grandfather. One family is the family of Solomon; the other is the family of Nathan. Under God’s sovereignty Mary and Joseph, descendants of these two families, were betrothed and brought forth Christ. Christ may be counted as the descendant of David through both Solomon and Nathan. This is the reason He has two genealogies.\r\nSolomon’s relationship with Christ was not direct. Strictly speaking, Solomon was not a direct forefather of Christ. His relationship with Christ was indirect through his descendant Joseph’s marriage to Mary, of whom Christ was born (Matt. 1:16).\r\nThe Old Testament did not say that Christ would be Solomon’s descendant, but it prophesied repeatedly that Christ would be the descendant of David (2 Sam. 7:13-14, 16; Jer. 23:5). Although Christ was not a direct descendant of Solomon, the Old Testament prophecies concerning Christ were nevertheless fulfilled.\r\n\r\nVerse 11 says, “Josiah begot Jeconiah.” Compare this record with “the sons of Josiah...the second Jehoiakim...and the sons of Jehoiakim; Jeconiah his son” (1 Chron. 3:15-16). One generation—Jehoiakim—was omitted from the genealogy of Christ. This must have been because he was made king by Pharaoh of Egypt and collected tax for Pharaoh (2 Kings 23:34-35). Because he was so closely related to Egypt, he was excluded from the genealogy of Christ. Egypt represents the world. From these two records we see that anyone who is related to idols or associated with the world will be excluded from the generation of Christ.\r\n\r\nThose who were carried away to Babylon as captives (vv. 11-12) were indirectly related to Christ through their descendant Joseph’s marriage with Mary. Even these captives are included in this sacred record of Christ’s genealogy because they had an indirect relationship through Mary, the mother of Jesus.\r\n\r\nW. Jeconiah\r\nJeconiah was not reckoned as a king in this genealogy because he was born during the captivity and was carried away as a captive (2 Chron. 36:9-10, Jehoiachin is Jeconiah). According to the prophecy of Jeremiah 22:28-30, none of Jeconiah’s descendants would inherit the throne of David. All of his descendants were cut off from David’s throne. If Christ had been a direct descendant of Jeconiah, He would not have been entitled to the throne of David. Although Jeremiah 22:28-30 says that all the descendants of Jeconiah are excluded from the throne of David, the next chapter, verse 5, says that God will raise up a branch to David, a King who will reign and prosper. This Branch is Christ. This prophecy confirms that Christ will be the descendant of David, although not a direct descendant of Jeconiah, and will inherit the throne of David.\r\n\r\n Y. Zerubbabel\r\nEzra 5:1 and 2 say that Zerubbabel was one of the leaders who returned to Jerusalem from the captivity at Babylon. This means that he was a leader in the Lord’s recovery. This is a great thing. He was also a leader in the rebuilding of God’s temple (Zech. 4:7-10).\r\nWithout this return from captivity, it would have been impossible for Christ to be born at Bethlehem. The Old Testament definitely predicted that Christ, as the descendant of David, would be born in Bethlehem (Matt. 2:4-6; Micah 5:2). Suppose none of the people of Israel had returned to Judah, and the time came for Christ to be born at Bethlehem. No one would have been there. Now we can understand why God commanded the captives to return. God’s commandment that the captives return was not only for the rebuilding of the temple but also the preparation for Christ to be born in Bethlehem.\r\nIt is exactly the same today. Some may ask, “What is the difference between remaining at Babylon and returning to Jerusalem? Isn’t it the same, as long as we worship God and walk in the spirit?” It may be all right with you, but it is not all right with Christ. Christ needs some people to bring Him to Bethlehem. You may worship God and you may walk in the spirit in Babylon, but be assured that Christ could never be born into humanity through you. This requires a specific place. You must return from Babylon to Judah. When the time came for the Lord Jesus to be born, some Israelites, descendants of the returned captives, were waiting in Judah. At that time, Joseph and Mary were not in Babylon; they were in Judah. For Christ to come to earth, some of His captured people had to return. For His second coming, Christ also needs some of His captured people to return from their captivity to the proper church life.\r\n\r\nZ. Jacob Begetting Joseph\r\nThe genealogy here says, “Jacob begot Joseph” (v. 16), but Luke 3:23 says, “Joseph, the son of Heli.” Whose son was Joseph? Luke’s record says “as was supposed.” A literal translation would be “as to the law.” This indicates that Joseph was not actually the son of Heli, but was reckoned as his son according to the law. Joseph was the son-in-law of Heli, Mary’s father. This might have been a case according to Numbers 27:1-8 and 36:1-12, in which a regulation was made by God that if any parents had only daughters as heirs, their inheritance should go to the daughters; the daughters then must marry a man of their own tribe in order to keep their inheritance within that tribe. If we did not have Matthew chapter one we may wonder why such a record exists. Now we see that this is not merely the record of a certain regulation; it is a matter related to Christ, because the virgin daughter who brought forth Christ was such a case. We believe that Mary’s parents had no sons and that she inherited her parent’s heritage and married Joseph, a man of the same tribe, the tribe of Judah. Even the regulation in Numbers 27 and 36 is related to the genealogy of Christ. Either directly or indirectly the whole Bible is a record of Christ.\r\n\r\nAA. Joseph the Husband of Mary,\r\nof Whom Jesus Was Born\r\nAt this point, the record of this genealogy does not say “Joseph begot Jesus,” as mentioned of all the foregoing persons; it says, “Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus” (v. 16). Jesus was born of Mary, not of Joseph, since it was prophesied that Christ would be the seed of a woman and born of a virgin (Gen. 3:15; Isa. 7:14). Christ could not have been born of Joseph, because Joseph was a man and a descendant of Jeconiah, of whose descendants none could inherit the throne of David (Jer. 22:28-30). If Christ had been born of Joseph, he would have been excluded from the throne of David. However, Mary was a virgin (Luke 1:27) and a descendant of David (Luke 1:31-32), the right person of whom Christ should be born. The marriage of Joseph with Mary brought him into relationship with Christ and united into one the two lines of Christ’s genealogy for the bringing forth of Christ.\r\nNow we need to examine the chart (p. 52) which shows that the generation of Christ begins from God and continues until it reaches Jesus. The first name is God, and the last name is Jesus. It proceeds from God to Adam, from Adam to Abraham, from Abraham through Isaac and Jacob and on to David. After David, it is divided into two lines, the first running from Nathan to Mary and the second from Solomon to Joseph. Eventually, in God’s sovereignty, these two lines are brought together by the marriage of Mary to Joseph to bring forth Christ. If we spend time to consider this chart, we shall realize how wonderful is God’s sovereignty.\r\nAll marriages are under God’s sovereignty, especially marriages related to Christ. From God to David the genealogy was one line, and from David to Jesus it was two lines; yet these two lines were united through the marriage of Joseph and Mary. The Jesus who was brought forth by Mary fulfills the prophecies: the prophecy concerning the seed of woman (Gen. 3:15); the prophecy of a virgin bringing forth a son (Isa. 7:14); the prophecy of Abraham having a seed who would bring blessing to all the nations (Gen. 22:18); the prophecy to Isaac and Jacob, which was the same as the prophecy made to Abraham (Gen. 26:4; 28:14); the prophecy made to Judah that Judah would be the royal tribe (Gen. 49:10); and the prophecy made to David (2 Sam. 7:12-13). Although the birth of Jesus fulfilled many prophecies in the Old Testament, He was not the descendant of Jeconiah. Seemingly, the descendants of Jeconiah were still in the royal line. But according to God’s sovereignty, Mary, the mother of Jesus, married Joseph, a descendant of Jeconiah, who seemed to be in the line of the royal family. Apparently, Jesus was the descendant of Jeconiah; actually, He was not. He was the descendant of David. Only God can arrange such a thing. Praise Him!\r\nIf you consider your history, the history of your salvation, you will see that the principle is the same. Do not think that the marriage of Joseph and Mary was an accident. It was no accident; rather it was planned by the sovereign hand of God. Likewise, your association with Christ—your salvation—was not an accident; it also was planned by the divine hand. Sometimes I have thanked the Lord and said to Him, “I am so happy that You did not put me on earth in 20 B.C., but in the twentieth century. You put me on this earth in a place where the missionaries came with the Bible. One day I was born of a Christian mother. Later, I was given the opportunity to hear the gospel, and I was saved. Hallelujah!” This was no accident. Neither was your association with Christ an accident. God carefully planned it all. God has arranged all this for little people like us. This is not an insignificant matter. When we enter eternity, we may be very surprised. We may shout, “Praise the Lord!”\r\n\r\nDD. Abraham, David, and Mary\r\nAbraham, David, and Mary are three pleasant names in the Bible, names sweet to the ears of God (vv. 2, 6, 16). Abraham represents a life by faith, David represents a life under the dealing of the cross, and Mary represents a life of absolute surrender to the Lord. It was through these three kinds of lives that Christ was brought forth into humanity.\r\nThe principle is the same today. Consider the matter of preaching the gospel. The purpose of preaching the gospel is to bring Christ into humanity. This requires a great deal of faith, a life under the dealing of the cross, and a life of absolute surrender to the Lord. If we have these kinds of lives, we shall surely bring Christ into humanity.\r\n\r\nGG. Three Groups of Fourteen Generations\r\nVerse 17 mentions three groups of fourteen generations. The number fourteen is composed of ten plus four. Four signifies the creatures. In Revelation 4:6 we have the four living creatures, and in Revelation 7:1 we have “the four corners of the earth” and “the four winds.” The number ten signifies fullness. We often speak of one tenth, meaning the tenth part of fullness (see Gen. 14:20). Therefore, in Matthew 25:1 we have ten virgins. Look at your two hands and your feet: you have ten fingers and ten toes. Thus, the number ten denotes fullness, and the number fourteen signifies the creatures in full.\r\nThree times of fourteen generations indicates that the Triune God mingles Himself with the creatures in full. This is very meaningful. The Persons of the Triune God are the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. This genealogy is of three sections: the section of the fathers, the section of the kings, and the section of the civilians, including the captured ones and the recovered ones. God the Father fits into the section of the fathers, God the Son fits into the section of the kings, and God the Spirit fits into the section of the civilians. This is wonderful! Therefore, three times fourteen means the mingling of the Triune God with His creatures. This record of the generation of Christ indicates the mingling of the Triune God with these human creatures.\r\nThe Triune God has been traveling through Abraham and Isaac, Jacob and Judah, Boaz and Obed, Jesse and David, and then through many other generations to Mary and Joseph. Finally, Jesus came. Who is Jesus? Jesus is the Triune God traveling through all the generations and coming forth as the mingling of divinity with humanity.\r\nThree times fourteen is forty-two. Forty is the number of trials, temptations, and sufferings (Heb. 3:9; Matt. 4:2; 1 Kings 19:8). Christ is the forty-second generation. Forty-two signifies rest and satisfaction after trials. Numbers 33:5-48 shows us that the children of Israel traveled through forty-two stations before they came into Canaan. According to the record of the Old Testament, the Israelites suffered all the way through these forty-two stations. They were tried, they were tempted, and they were tested. They had no rest. However, after passing through these forty-two stations, they entered into rest. This not only happened in the past, but will happen again in the future. In Revelation 13, we see that there will be forty-two months, three and one-half years. These forty-two months will be the concluding part of the final seven years, the last week mentioned in Daniel 9:24-27. There are seventy weeks: the first seven weeks, then sixty-two weeks, and then the last week, each week representing seven years. The second half of these last seven years, a period of forty-two months, will be the great tribulation, and it will be awful. There will be many trials, testings, temptations, and sufferings. But, when these forty-two months have been completed, the kingdom will come and there will be rest. From Abraham through Mary was a time of sufferings, tests, and temptations. After all the generations of trials, temptations, and sufferings, Christ came as the forty-second generation to be our rest and satisfaction. With Him we have complete rest and full satisfaction.\r\nIf we read the history in Chronicles, we shall discover that the generations from Abraham to Christ were actually forty-five generations. Why then does Matthew have only forty-two? By deducting from the forty-five generations the three cursed generations and the one improper generation, and by making David two generations (one of the fathers and one of the kings), the generations become forty-two, which are divided into three ages of fourteen generations each.\r\nRemember: this is not only a life-study, but also a Bible study. Hence, we need some knowledge. We need to see that the record of Matthew is not a record according to history, but a record according to doctrine. The record of John, on the contrary, is according to history, for John wrote his Gospel according to the events of history. According to history, it was forty-five generations, but according to Matthew’s doctrinal purpose, it was forty-two generations. Matthew must have had a doctrinal purpose in saying that from Abraham to David was fourteen generations, from David to the carrying away was another fourteen generations, and from the carrying away to Christ was still another fourteen generations. It was not inaccurate for Matthew to say this. Three generations were omitted because they were not qualified, and a fourth generation was disqualified and cut off. But there was a wonderful person, David the king, who was doubly qualified. He became two generations, closing one section and opening another. He brought in the kingship, for through him the kingdom was established. Therefore, by David’s being counted as two generations, this genealogy of Christ can consist of forty-two generations in three sections, each with fourteen generations.\r\nHH. “To the Christ”\r\nLet us now consider the words “to the Christ” (v. 17). Luke’s record begins with Jesus and traces back to God, a total of seventy-seven generations. Matthew’s record proceeds from Abraham to Christ. Luke goes back and up to God; Matthew comes forward and down to Christ. All the generations were directed toward Christ and brought forth Christ. Without Christ, there are just forty-one generations; there is no goal, no consummation, and no conclusion. Forty-one is not a good number; we must have the number forty-two. Christ is the goal, the consummation, the conclusion, the completion, and the perfection of all the generations, fulfilling their prophecies, solving their problems, and meeting their needs. Christ came to fulfill all the prophecies, the prophecies of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Judah, and David. Without the coming of Christ, all these prophecies would have been in vain. When Christ comes, light, life, salvation, satisfaction, healing, freedom, rest, comfort, peace, and joy all come with Him. From this point on, the whole New Testament is the full expounding of this wonderful Christ. The twenty-seven books of the New Testament—the Gospels, the Acts, the Epistles, and Revelation—tell us how this Christ fulfills all the prophecies, solves all our problems, and meets all our needs and how He is everything to us. Hallelujah, Christ has come!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe genealogy in Matthew begins with Abraham, but the genealogy in Luke goes back to Adam. Matthew does not cover Adam and his descendants, but Luke does. What is the meaning of this difference? Luke is a book of God’s salvation, whereas Matthew is a book of the kingdom. God’s salvation is for the created and fallen race represented by Adam, but the kingdom of the heavens is only for God’s chosen people, the called race represented by Abraham. Therefore, Matthew starts from Abraham, but Luke traces the genealogy back to Adam.\r\n1. Called\r\nIn the first ten and a half chapters of Genesis God tried to work with the created race, but He did not get through. The created race failed Him. Man fell to such an extent that all mankind rebelled against God to the uttermost, and built the tower and city of Babel to express their rebellion (Gen. 11:1-9). So God gave up the created and fallen race, and He called one, Abraham, out of that race to be the father of another race. Out of a place filled with rebellion and idolatry, a place where everyone was one with Satan, God called a man named Abraham (Gen. 12:1-2; Heb. 11:8). From the time God called him out of Babel (later Babylon) into Canaan, God gave up the Adamic race and invested all His interest in this new race, with Abraham as its head. This is the called race, the transformed race. It is not a race according to nature, but a race according to faith.\r\nGod’s kingdom is for this race. It could never be with the fallen race. Thus, Matthew, dealing with the kingdom of the heavens, begins with Abraham, Because the book of Luke concerns God’s salvation (and surely salvation must be for the fallen race), his genealogy goes back to Adam. After being saved in Luke, we are spontaneously transferred from the fallen race to the called race. We used to be descendants of Adam; now we are descendants of Abraham. Galatians 3:7 and 29 tell us that whoever believes in Jesus Christ is a son of Abraham. Whose son are you? Are you the son of Adam or the son of Abraham? We are the real Jews (Rom. 2:29). Our grandfather is Abraham. We are in the same category he is. If we were not descendants of Abraham, then we would have no share in the book of Matthew. We would not even have a share in the short book of Galatians, because Galatians was written to the descendants of Abraham. Only if we are descendants of Abraham do we have a share in Galatians. Praise the Lord that we are the sons of Abraham! “If you are Christ’s, then you are Abraham’s seed, heirs according to promise” (Gal. 3:29).\r\nAbraham was called out by God. The Greek word for church, ecclesia, means “the called out ones.” Thus, we in the church are also the called out ones. Abraham was called out of Babel, the place of rebellion and idolatry, into the good land, which typifies Christ. We also were in Babel. We were fallen, we were rebellious, and we worshipped idols. Today the whole human race is in Babel. We used to be there, but one day God called us out and put us into Christ, the high land. We were called by God into “the fellowship [the participation] of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord” (1 Cor. 1:9). “To those who are called,...Christ, [is] God’s power and God’s wisdom” (1 Cor. 1:24).\r\n2. Justified by Faith\r\nAbraham, as a called one, was justified by faith (Gen. 15:6; Rom. 4:2-3). The fallen ones depend on their work, but the called ones believe in God’s work, not in their own work. No fallen person can be justified by works in the sight of God (Rom. 3:20). Therefore, the called ones, having been called by God out of the fallen race, put no trust in their own effort; they trust in God’s work of grace. Abraham and all other believers are like this. “They who are of faith are blessed with believing Abraham” (Gal. 3:9). The blessing of God’s promise, “the promise of the Spirit” (Gal. 3:14), is for the believing ones. By faith we received the Spirit, which is the reality and realization of Christ (Gal. 3:2). Thus, both Abraham and we are associated with Christ and joined to Him by faith. It is by faith in God’s work of grace that God’s called people are justified by Him and participate in Christ, their eternal portion.\r\n\r\n 3. Living by Faith\r\nHebrews 11:8 says that Abraham was called, and that he answered this call by faith. Then, verse 9 says that he also lived in the good land by faith. As the called one of God, not only was Abraham justified by faith, but he also lived by faith. As one called by God, he should no longer live and walk by himself, but live and walk by faith. For Abraham to live and walk by faith meant that he had to reject himself, to forget himself, to set himself aside, and to live by Someone else. Whatever he had by nature had to be set aside.\r\nIf we compare Genesis 11:31 and 12:1 with Acts 7:2-3, we see that when God called Abraham in Ur of the Chaldees, he was very weak. Abraham did not take the initiative to leave Babel; his father, Terah, did. This forced God to take away Abraham’s father. In Genesis 12:1 God called him again, telling him to leave not only his country and his kindred, but also his father’s house, which meant not to bring anyone with him. But once again Abraham, like us, was weak and he took Lot, his nephew (Gen. 12:5).\r\nWhat is an Abraham? An Abraham is a person who has been called out, who no longer lives and walks by himself, and who forsakes and forgets everything he has by nature. This is exactly the message of the book of Galatians. Galatians 3 says that we are the sons of Abraham and that we should live by faith, not by our works. Galatians 2:20 says that to live by faith means “no longer I who live, but Christ.” I, the natural I who came out of the fallen race, have been crucified and buried. Thus, it is no longer I, but Christ who lives in me. This is Abraham. If we are true Jews, the real descendants of Abraham, we must leave everything and live by faith. We must forget about all that we can do and repudiate all that we are and have by nature. This is not easy.\r\nChristians appreciate Abraham very much. However, we should not esteem Abraham too highly. He was not that outstanding. He was called, but he did not dare to leave Babel; his father took him out. This forced God to remove his father. Then Abraham relied on his nephew, Lot. After this, he put his trust in his servant, Eliezer (Gen. 15:2-4). It seemed that God was saying, “Abraham, I don’t like to see your father with you, I don’t like to see your nephew with you, and I don’t like to see Eliezer with you. I want you to have no one to rely upon. You must rely on Me. Don’t depend upon anything else or anything you have by nature.” This is believing in God, walking in Him, and living by Him. It is no longer I, but Christ who lives in me.\r\nIf we are real Jews, then we are real Abrahams. In order to be an Abraham, we must believe in the Lord. To believe in the Lord is to become associated with Him. Abraham was called out of the fallen race, and he became associated with the Lord. All the sons of Abraham must likewise be associated with Christ. “If ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed.” In other words, if we are the seed of Abraham, we belong to Christ and we are associated with Christ. If we would be associated with Christ, we must repudiate ourselves and take Christ as everything. This is believing in Christ, and this believing is righteousness in the eyes of God. Do not try to do anything. Simply believe in Christ.\r\nThe fallen race always likes to do something, to work and to exert some effort. But God says, “Come out of that. You are the called race. Don’t try, don’t do, and don’t work any more! Forget your past. Forget what you are, what you can do, and what you have. Forget everything, and put your full trust in Me. I am your good land. Live in Me, and live by Me.” These are the real Abrahams, the real Galatians. As the sons of God, they trust in God and forget about themselves. These are the ones who make up the generation of Christ. We all must be Abrahams, those who forget their past, give up what they are and have, and put their trust in Christ, their good land. Today our walk and our living must be by faith in Christ. If so, then, as heirs of God’s promise, as those who inherit the promise of the Spirit, we shall participate in Christ as God’s blessing.\r\nAt a certain time the Lord asked Abraham to offer Isaac, the one God had given according to His promise, for a burnt offering (Gen. 22:1-2). The Lord had given Isaac to Abraham; now Abraham had to give Isaac back to the Lord. The Lord had already charged him to cast out Ishmael (Gen. 21:10, 12); now He charged him to kill his son Isaac.\r\nAre you able to do this? What a difficult lesson this is! Nevertheless, this is the way to experience Christ. Last month or last week you may have experienced Christ in a certain way, but today the Lord says, “Consecrate that experience. That was a real experience of Christ, but don’t keep it.” Again, the lesson is to never trust in what we have, not even in what God has given us. If God has given you something, it must be given back to Him. This is the daily walk by faith. To walk in the presence of the Lord by faith means that we do not hold on to anything, not even to the things given by God. The best gifts, given by the Lord Himself, must be given back to Him. Do not keep anything as something to rely on; rely only and always on the Lord. Abraham did this. Eventually he lived and walked in the presence of God purely by faith.\r\n\r\n F. Jacob\r\nVerse 2 also says, “Isaac begot Jacob.” Isaac and Ishmael were brothers by the same father, but by different mothers. Jacob and Esau were more intimate; they were twins. Jacob means a superseder. He supersedes others, puts them under him, and climbs above them. When he and his older brother Esau were coming out of the womb, Jacob held Esau’s heel. Jacob seemed to be saying, “Esau, don’t go yet! Wait for me. Let me go first!” Jacob was a real heel-holder. The meaning of the name Jacob is the heel-holder, the supplanter. Beat others down. Put them under your feet by any deceitful means. That is Jacob.\r\nBecause God had already chosen Jacob, all his endeavors were in vain. Jacob needed a vision. He did not need to supplant others, because God had chosen him to be number one. Even before the twins were born, God had told the mother that the younger would be the first, and the elder would be second. It is written, “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated” (Mal. 1:2-3; Rom. 9:13).\r\nUnfortunately, Jacob did not realize this. If he had, he never would have tried to do anything. Rather, he would have said to Esau, “If you want to go out first, just go out. No matter how much you try to be first, I will still be first. You can never beat me because God elected me.” Jacob, however, did not know this. Even when he had grown up, he still did not realize it. Therefore, he was constantly supplanting. Wherever he went, he supplanted. He supplanted his brother (Gen. 25:29-33; 27:18-38), and he supplanted his uncle (Gen. 30:37—31:1). He schemed and he stole from his uncle, Laban. Yet, all his labor was in vain. God could say, “Stupid Jacob. You don’t need to do that. I will give you more than what you have gained.” But Jacob kept striving. Although he was a descendant of Abraham, according to his striving and his nature, he was altogether a descendant of the Devil. Do you see this? Positionally speaking, Jacob was a descendant of Abraham, but dispositionally speaking, he was a child of the Devil.\r\nWhat did Jacob need? He needed God’s dealing. Hence, God raised up his brother, Esau, and then his uncle, Laban, to deal with him. God even raised up four wives plus twelve male helpers and a female helper. There was a great deal of suffering in the life of Jacob, but this suffering came from his striving, not from God’s election. The more Jacob strove, the more he suffered. We may laugh at Jacob, but we are exactly the same as he. The more we try to do something, the more problems we have.\r\nIn Christ, we need, firstly, the life of Abraham. We need to forget what we are, live by Christ, and trust in Him. Secondly, in Christ we have no need of Ishmael, our doing; we need Isaac, His doing. Thirdly, we do not need Jacob, but Israel. We do not need the natural Jacob, but the transformed Israel, the prince of God.\r\nDo you realize that it is absolutely not up to you? When you hear this, you may say, “If it is not up to me, but completely up to God, then I’ll stop my seeking.” Good. If you can stop your seeking, I encourage you to do it. Tell the whole universe that you have heard that it is up to Him, and that you have stopped your seeking. If you can stop it, it should be stopped. But, I assure you, the more you stop, the better. The more you stop, the more He will stand up. Try it. Tell the Lord, “Lord, I stop my seeking!” The Lord would say, “That’s wonderful! Your stopping opens the door for Me to do something. I will burn you. You may stop your seeking, but I will burn you!”\r\nWe all have been elected. In a sense, we are caught. What can we do? We can never get away. This is absolutely due to the Lord’s mercy. We did not choose this way. I certainly did not choose it, but here I am. What can I do? What can I say? Because God has chosen us, we can never get away.\r\nIf we read Romans 9, we shall discover that it is up to Him, not us. He was and still is the source. Praise Him that His mercy has come to us! No one can reject His mercy. We may reject His doing, but we can never reject His mercy (Exo. 33:19; Rom. 9:15). What a mercy that we have been selected to be associated with Christ and to participate in Him as God’s eternal blessing! In one sense we are Abraham, in another sense we are Isaac, and in still another sense, we are Jacob. Later, in a fourth sense, we shall be Israel. Thus, we have Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.\r\nThe genealogy of Christ is a matter of the birthright, and the birthright is mainly the association with Christ and the participation in Christ. Jacob’s supplanting was not justified, but his seeking after the birthright surely was honored by God. Esau despised the birthright and sold it cheaply (Gen. 25:29-34). Thus, he lost it and was not able to get it back, even when he regretted and wept for it (Gen. 27:34-38; Heb. 12:16-17). He had lost the blessing of participating in Christ. This should be a warning to us. Jacob respected and sought the birthright, and he obtained it. He inherited God’s promised blessing, the blessing of Christ (Gen. 28:4, 14).\r\n\r\nAll Christians have been reborn as priests (Rev. 1:6). But today many have lost their priesthood. Because they have lost their praying position, it is hard for them to pray. If we would keep our priesthood, we must be like the Levites, and forget our father, our brothers, and our children and take care of God’s interest. God’s desire, not our families, must be first. If God’s desire has first place in our hearts, then we shall be close to Him and keep the priesthood.\r\n\r\nHebrews 12:16-17 warns us not to lose our birthright as Esau did. “For one meal” Esau “gave up his birthright.” Later, he regretted that he had sold it so cheaply, but he was not able to get it back. We all need to be on the alert. We have the position to possess the birthright and we have it already, but maintaining it depends on whether or not we keep ourselves from being profane or becoming defiled. We have seen that Esau lost his birthright because he was profane and that Reuben lost his birthright because of his defilement. But Joseph inherited the double portion of land because of his purity; Levi obtained the priesthood because of his absolute separation unto the Lord; and Judah received the kingship because of his care for his suffering brothers. We need to keep ourselves pure for the extra portion of the enjoyment of Christ; we need to separate ourselves absolutely to the Lord with a heart caring for the Lord’s desire above all things; we need to care lovingly for our suffering brothers. If we are like this, we shall surely keep our birthright. The extra portion of the enjoyment of Christ, the priesthood, and the kingship will be ours. Even today we can enjoy Christ in a double measure. We can pray, we can rule, and we can reign. Then, when the Lord Jesus returns, we shall be with Him enjoying the inheritance of this earth. We shall be priests contacting God continually and kings reigning over the people.\r\nBecause Judah gained the kingship portion of the birthright, he brought forth the kingly Christ (Gen. 49:10), Christ the Victor (Rev. 5:5; Gen. 49:8-9). “It is clearly evident that our Lord has risen out of Judah” (Heb. 7:14).\r\nAbraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Judah are all associates of Christ. If we have the life of these four generations—Abraham’s faith, Isaac’s inheritance, Jacob’s dealings, and Judah’s care of love—then we are the associates of Christ in His generation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTamar was the wife of the first son of Judah. This son should have inherited the birthright. But Tamar’s husband was wicked in the eyes of the Lord, and the Lord took his life (Gen. 38:7). The Lord also slew Judah’s second son (Gen. 38:8-10). According to the ancient regulations, Judah should have arranged for his next son to marry Tamar in order that a son might be brought forth to inherit the birthright. Judah, however, did not fulfill his responsibility. In a sense, Judah cheated Tamar (Gen. 38:11-14). But Tamar did not give up; rather, she even used an unseemly means to obtain the birthright. Whether the means was unseemly or not, Tamar did her best to get that birthright.\r\nTo have the birthright is simply to gain Christ. In order to gain Christ, we must be ready to take a way that does not seem to be the best way. Let me tell you a story that illustrates this, but try to understand me; do not misunderstand me. In the past, some young people in China were inspired by my preaching, believed in the Lord Jesus, and desired to be baptized. However, their parents, who were Buddhists, were very much opposed to this. When they learned that their children were planning to be baptized, they gave them no opportunity to leave home. The young people prayed about this. Eventually, they told their parents that they had to be in school for a certain half-day period. That was surely a lie, for they did not go to school; they went to the church to be baptized. Although they told a lie, it was a pure lie. Their intention in telling that lie was very pleasing to God. If you want to gain Christ, you should not care for the way. Do not be religious; do not keep the rules and regulations. Gain Christ! You need to gain Christ. By any means, get the birthright.\r\nIt was through an unseemly means that Tamar acquired the birthright. But in the divine record in the Bible, the name of Tamar is not a bad name. Ruth 4:12 indicates that this name is sacred. In this verse the elders said, “And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare unto Judah.” The name of Tamar is sacred because she did not care for anything sinful; she cared only for the birthright. The significance of this for us today is that if we care for Christ and are seeking Him, any way we can truly gain Him is the right way.\r\n\r\nK. Rahab\r\nWe proceed to Rahab (v. 5). Rahab was a harlot in Jericho (Josh. 2:1), a place cursed by God for eternity. Although she was a harlot in such a place, she became a grandmother of Christ. How could a harlot become a grandmother of Christ? In order to answer this question, we need to find the principles. The entire population of Jericho was destroyed except Rahab, her family, and her possessions. She was saved because she turned to God and God’s people (Josh. 6:22-23, 25; Heb. 11:31). After she turned to God and His people, she married Salmon, a leader in the army of the leading tribe of Judah and one of the men sent by Joshua to spy out Jericho. At that time, Salmon became acquainted with Rahab and, in a sense, saved her. Eventually, Rahab married him, and they brought forth a godly man named Boaz.\r\nNow we must pay our full attention to the principles governing our association with Christ. The first principle is that, no matter what our background is, we must turn to God and to God’s people. Second, we must marry the proper person, not in a physical sense, but in a spiritual sense. After we have turned to God and to God’s people, we must be joined, built up, and involved with the proper person. Third, we must bring forth the proper fruit. Then we will be fully in the portion of the birthright of Christ.\r\nIt seems that many Christians today have lost their birthright. They do not have Salmon and Boaz. If you would have a Salmon and a Boaz, you must become involved with the proper believers, with the proper leading ones in the leading tribes. Then you need to bring forth the proper fruit, Boaz, who will be a forefather of David. We must turn to the Lord, and we must turn to the Lord’s people; we must also take care of how we become involved with others. If we become involved with the proper persons, surely we shall bring forth the proper fruit. This will keep us in the full enjoyment of the birthright of Christ.\r\nL. Boaz\r\nIf we are to know the story of Boaz, we must read the book of Ruth. It is a good story. Boaz is a type of Christ, and Ruth is a type of the church. The book of Ruth tells us that Boaz redeemed Ruth; he also redeemed the birthright for her. This means that Christ, as our real Boaz, has redeemed both us and the birthright.\r\nBoaz redeemed his kinsman’s inheritance and married the man’s widow (Ruth 4:1-17); hence, he became a notable forefather of Christ, a great associate of Christ. As a brother and a Boaz, you should take care of others’ birthright of Christ, not only your own birthright. In other words, you should not only take care of your own enjoyment of Christ, but also others’ enjoyment of Christ.\r\nRuth was the daughter-in-law of Naomi. As we read this story, we see that Ruth and Naomi had lost the enjoyment, the birthright, but according to God’s regulation there was a way to restore the birthright, to redeem it. But it had to be redeemed by someone else. The principle is the same in the church life today. If I lose the birthright, the brothers have a way to redeem it for me. Quite often, some dear ones lose their enjoyment of Christ. In a sense, they become Naomi or Ruth. If so, you need to be a Boaz, able to redeem the lost birthright and marry the redeemed one.\r\nSuppose I am a real Ruth who has lost her husband. To lose the husband means to lose the enjoyment of the birthright. I have the birthright, but I have lost the enjoyment of the birthright. Thus, I need you, as my brother, to redeem my birthright. But you need to be somewhat richer in Christ. You need to have some riches with which to redeem my birthright. Then you pay the price to regain my birthright, and you also marry me. This means that you become involved with me. This kind of spiritual involvement will produce Obed, the grandfather of David. Boaz became one of the great forefathers of Christ. In a spiritual sense, he was the one who enjoyed the largest and richest portion of Christ. If a brother becomes a Boaz to me, he will be the one with the greatest enjoyment of Christ. Because he redeemed my birthright and became so involved with me, our involvement in the Lord will eventually bring forth the full enjoyment of Christ.\r\nIn the church life today we need to have a number of Boazes. The book of Ruth tells us that there was another kinsman who was even closer to Ruth than Boaz was. But that man was selfish; he only took care of his own birthright. He was afraid that taking care of another’s might mar his own. This is exactly today’s situation. Some brothers should take care of me, the poor Ruth, but they are selfish in the spiritual enjoyment of Christ. Even in the spiritual enjoyment of Christ it is quite possible to be selfish. However, a Boaz will be generous and pay the price to redeem my birthright. All this indicates that we should take care of not only our own birthright, but also others’ birthright. Day by day we should take care of others’ enjoyment of Christ. The more we do this, the better.\r\n\r\n P. The Wife of Uriah (Bathsheba)\r\nDavid murdered Uriah and took his wife, Bathsheba. She was the wife of a Hittite, a heathen (2 Sam. 11:3). She was remarried as a result of adultery (2 Sam. 11:26-27).\r\nQ. Solomon\r\nAfter David committed murder and adultery, he was rebuked by the prophet Nathan, whom God sent purposely to condemn him (2 Sam. 12:1-12). After he was condemned, David repented. Psalm 51 is David’s psalm of repentance. David repented and God forgave (2 Sam. 12:13). There was repentance and there was forgiveness. Altogether we have three items here: transgression, repentance, and forgiveness. If we put all three together, the result is Solomon. First there were transgression and repentance plus forgiveness. After that, there was Solomon (2 Sam. 12:24), the one who built God’s temple. Solomon is the result not only of transgression and repentance, but of transgression, repentance, and God’s forgiveness. Here we see two marriages. The first was a marriage between David and Bathsheba. The second was a spiritual marriage, the marriage of David’s transgression and repentance with God’s forgiveness. God’s forgiveness married David’s transgression and repentance. This marriage brought forth the man named Solomon who built the temple of God. The church is always built up by this kind of person, Solomon, the issue of man’s transgression and repentance plus God’s forgiveness.\r\nAfter David received God’s forgiveness and the joy of his salvation was restored, he prayed for Zion, for the building of the walls of Jerusalem, for the strengthening of his kingdom (Psa. 51:18). Eventually, as the result of God’s forgiveness of his sin, God gave him a son to build the temple of God for God’s presence as the center of the city of Jerusalem.\r\nI hope the Lord will show you what human words cannot say. If you have been and still are a typically good person who has never murdered others, who has never transgressed, and who has never needed to repent, then God does not need to forgive you. If this is the case, then there will never be a Solomon, and the temple of God will never be built up. As we have seen, the building up of God’s temple comes from man’s transgression and repentance plus God’s forgiveness.\r\nOne day I said to the Lord, “Lord, my transgression and repentance need Your forgiveness. But, Lord, You know better than I that Your forgiveness also needs my transgression. My transgression needs Your forgiveness, and Your forgiveness needs my transgression. If I have no transgressions, then You don’t have a place to spend Your forgiveness.” When I said this to the Lord, it seemed that He said, “Yes. Because of your transgression and repentance, I do have an opportunity to spend My forgiveness. I am happy about this.” But you should never say, “Let us do evil that good may come.” You must do your best. But no matter how hard you may try to do everything right in the eyes of the Lord, sooner or later something will happen. Suddenly, you will murder, take over others, transgress. However, after you transgress, there will be a way for you to repent. If you repent, God will be ready to forgive you. Then you will beget a son and name him Solomon. The name Solomon means “peaceful” (2 Sam. 12:24; 1 Chron. 22:9). But Solomon also has another name, “Jedidiah” (2 Sam. 12:25), which means “beloved of the Lord.” To you, Solomon means “peaceful,” but to the Lord, he means “beloved of the Lord.” This son will be the one who will build up the house of God, today’s church.\r\nYou need to be right in the eyes of God all the time. But be assured that your being right is not good for building up the church. However, you should not say, “Let me do wrong!” I tell you, even if you try to be wrong, you will discover that you are not able to do wrong. I do not know what kind of sovereignty this is. But one day you will do something awful. All the brothers will shake their heads, unable to believe that you could have done such a thing. Nevertheless, you have done it! Then you need to read Psalm 51, make it your psalm, and go to the Lord, saying, “Lord, I repent. Against Thee and only Thee have I done this evil thing. Forgive me.” After this repentance, you will have another marriage, the marriage of your transgression and repentance with God’s forgiveness. This will bring forth a Solomon, one who is peaceful to you and beloved of the Lord. This person will build up the church, God’s temple. At that time you will be very useful in the building up of the church.\r\nYou may say, “What about today? What shall we do—wait for that kind of person to come?” No, do not wait. Your waiting does not avail. We should just walk in the presence of the Lord and let the Lord do it. As Charles Wesley said in one of his hymns, “’Tis mercy all!” Yes, it is altogether a matter of God’s mercy. Forget about your background, your situation, or what may happen in the future. You simply need to trust in the Lord’s sovereign mercy. If you have a heart for Him and for His people, He will work everything out. He will give you the full enjoyment of the birthright of Christ.\r\nThese verses in the genealogy of Christ are very difficult. They are not milk or meat; they are bones. If we spend an hour or two praying over these verses and over the points covered in this message, we shall see something more. We shall see that we need to be a person with a real seeking heart, a heart seeking God and God’s people. Then we shall be today’s Boaz, Ruth, Obed, Jesse, David, and eventually today’s Solomon, building up the house of God.\r\n\r\nII. HIS BIRTH\r\nIn this message we come to the birth of Christ. Because the birth of Christ is altogether a mystery, it is difficult to talk about it. First, we need to consider some matters related to the preparation for Christ’s birth.\r\nA. By God’s Sovereignty\r\nThe birth of Christ was prepared and carried out by God’s sovereignty (1:18; Luke 1:26-27). By His sovereignty, God brought Joseph and Mary together in marriage to bring forth Christ to be the legal heir to the throne of David. Marriage is a mystery. It is not easy to bring two persons together, especially when it concerns the birth of Christ. It was not a simple matter to bring Joseph and Mary together. Look into the history here. According to the genealogy of Christ in Matthew, Joseph was a descendant of Zerubbabel, a returned captive. Zerubbabel, a leader of the tribe of Judah and a descendant of the royal family, led the captives from Babylon to Jerusalem (Ezra 2:2). Eventually, he also took the lead in rebuilding the temple (Ezra 3:8; 5:2). Joseph was his descendant. If there had been no return of the captives, where would Joseph have been born? He would have been born in Babylon. The same would have been true for Mary, also a descendant of the returned captives. If the forefathers of Joseph and Mary had remained in Babylon and if both Mary and Joseph themselves had been born there, how could Jesus have been born of Mary in Bethlehem? Now we can see God’s sovereignty in bringing back the forefathers of Joseph and Mary.\r\nBy His sovereignty, God placed both Joseph and Mary in the same city, Nazareth (Luke 1:26; 2:4). If they had lived far away from each other, it would have been difficult for them to come together in marriage. Joseph and Mary not only were descendants of the returned captives, but also lived in the same little town. This allowed them to come together in marriage.\r\nFurthermore, when we examine the genealogies in Matthew and Luke, we discover that Joseph was a descendant of the royal line, the line of Solomon (v. 6-7), and Mary was a descendant of the common line, the line of Nathan (Luke 3:31). Although Joseph and Mary came together in marriage, Jesus was born of Mary, not of Joseph. Apparently, He was born of Joseph; actually, He was born of Mary (1:16). This was absolutely a matter of God’s sovereignty.\r\nAs we have seen in a previous message, the curse recorded in Jeremiah disqualified any descendant of Jeconiah from inheriting the throne of David (Jer. 22:28-30). If, in actuality, Jesus had been born of Joseph, He would have been disqualified from the throne of David. Because Joseph was still in the royal line, he was a royal descendant according to man’s eyes. By the marriage of Mary, Jesus’ mother, with Joseph, Jesus was apparently associated with this royal line. Again, we see God’s sovereignty. God found a young woman, also the descendant of David, to bring forth Christ. Jesus was born of her and was actually the seed of David qualified to inherit the throne of David.\r\nBy this sovereign arrangement, Jesus was both an ordinary person and the heir of the royal throne. This is the reason He has two genealogies, one in Luke, telling us of His common status, and another in Matthew, telling us of His royal status. His common status came from Mary, and His royal status came from Joseph. Thus Jesus was born by God’s sovereignty. None of us was born under this kind of God’s sovereignty. None of us was born under this kind of sovereignty. Only Jesus was qualified to enjoy such a sovereign arrangement.\r\n\r\n B. Through Mary’s Surrender\r\nAccording to Luke 1:26-38, the birth of Christ was carried out through Mary’s surrender. Here I would say a word to the young people. It was not easy for a young virgin like Mary to accept the commission to conceive a child. If I had been she, I would have said, “Lord, if You would ask me to do anything other than this, I would do it. But You ask me to conceive a child! This is not humanly possible; it is neither moral nor ethical. I can’t do it!” For us to read this record is easy. However, suppose a young sister among us were to receive such a commission tonight. Could she accept it? This is not an insignificant matter. Mary might have said, “Gabriel, don’t you know that I am espoused to a man already? How can I conceive a child?” Who among us would accept such a commission? If an angel spoke such a word to you, could you accept it?\r\nAfter listening to the word of the angel, Mary said, “Behold the slave of the Lord; may it be to me according to your word” (Luke 1:38). This may appear simple, but the price was extremely high. To bring forth Christ Mary paid a very high price—the cost of her whole being. It is not easy to bring forth Christ; it is not cheap. If we would bring forth Christ, we must pay a price. Mary did.\r\nJoseph reacted immediately, planning that he would put Mary away secretly (v. 19). Thus, Mary was in trouble. I assure you, whenever you accept the commission to bring forth Christ, you will find yourself in trouble. All the angels will understand you, but not one human being will understand. Do not expect anyone to be like the angel Gabriel. Everyone will misunderstand you. In fact, the person closest to you may misunderstand you the most. Nevertheless, in large measure, the birth of Christ was accomplished through Mary’s surrender.\r\nC. Of the Holy Spirit’s Power\r\nHowever, Mary’s surrender was not directly related to the conceiving of Jesus. The conceiving of Jesus was directly related to the Holy Spirit (vv. 18, 20; Luke 1:35). Without the Holy Spirit, Mary’s surrender would have meant nothing. No matter how much we may surrender, without the power of the Holy Spirit our surrender means nothing. Do not estimate your surrender too highly. Our surrender means little; it simply affords the opportunity for the Holy Spirit’s power to come into us and accomplish something.\r\nD. With Joseph’s Obedience and Coordination\r\nAlthough there was the sovereignty of God, the surrender of Mary, and the power of the Holy Spirit, there was the need of Joseph’s obedience and coordination (vv. 19-21, 24-25). What would have happened if Joseph had insisted on a divorce? He was planning this. However, he was the person selected by God for the birth of Christ. Therefore, he was not so rough and quick; rather, he was considerate and thoughtful. Because at that time Joseph was a young man, I would take this opportunity to say a word to the young people: Do not make decisions too fast or act too quickly. Be a little slow and give the Lord a chance to come in. At least, give the matter another night. During that night, the angel may come and speak to you. This happened to Joseph. While he thought on these things, the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream (v. 20). Joseph obeyed the word of the angel.\r\nSuppose you were engaged to a young girl and discovered that she was with child. Would you still take her? To take such a woman would surely be a shame. Therefore, not only Mary paid a price, but Joseph also paid a price. The bringing forth of Christ cost him a great deal, for it caused him to suffer shame.\r\nThe points we have covered thus far in this message are merely some minor points. We come now to the major points.\r\nE. Fulfilling the Prophecies\r\nThe birth of Christ was a great fulfillment of prophecies in the Old Testament. The first prophecy in the Old Testament is Genesis 3:15. There are no prophecies in chapters one and two of Genesis, but in chapter three, after the fall of man, after the serpent had worked himself into man through the woman, God gave a promise. In giving this promise, God seemed to say, “Serpent, you came in through the woman. Now I shall deal with you by the seed of this woman.” Thus, the promise concerning the seed of the woman was the first prophecy in the Bible.\r\nIn 1:22 and 23 this promise is fulfilled by a virgin conceiving a child. This child came to be the seed of the woman. In Galatians 4:4 Paul says that Christ was born under the law and also was born of the woman. Christ came not only to fulfill the law, but also to fulfill the promise that the seed of the woman would bruise the head of the serpent.\r\nFrom Genesis we proceed to Isaiah 7:14, where there is another prophecy concerning Christ. “Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son.” The fulfillment of this promise brought God into man. Hallelujah, God became man!\r\n\r\n F. God Becoming Flesh\r\nHowever, it is difficult to find a verse which says that God became man. What the Bible says is this: “The Word was God...and the Word became flesh” (John 1:1, 14). Man is a good term, but flesh is not. If I tell you that you are a man, you will be happy. But if I say that you are flesh, you will not be happy because the word flesh is not a positive term. In 1 Timothy 3:16 Paul says, “Great is the mystery... Who was manifested in the flesh.” Although flesh is not a good term, the Bible says that God was manifest in the flesh.\r\nIt is not easy to understand what the Bible means by the flesh. In the Bible the flesh has at least three meanings. First, in a good sense, it means the meat of our body (John 6:55). Our body has meat and bone, blood and skin. This is physical. Second, flesh means our fallen body. God did not create fallen flesh; He created a body. When man fell, the poison of Satan was injected into his body, and the body was corrupted and became the flesh. Therefore, Romans 7:18 says, “For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, nothing good dwells.” This indicates that the fallen body, the body of sin (Rom. 6:6), is called the flesh. All human lusts come from this flesh. Hence, the New Testament has the term “the lusts of our flesh” (Eph. 2:3). Third, the flesh, especially in the New Testament, means the fallen man. Romans 3:20 says, “By the works of the law no flesh shall be justified before Him.” In this verse flesh is the fallen man.\r\nNevertheless John 1:14 says, “The Word [which was God] became flesh.” As we have seen, flesh means the fallen man. How, then, shall we interpret John 1:14? The Word was God, and the Word became flesh. Great is the mystery that God was manifest in the flesh. The Bible says that God became flesh and that flesh is not the created man, but the fallen man. Can we say that God became a fallen man? This surely is a difficult matter.\r\nHowever, there are two verses that can help us. The first verse is Romans 8:3, which says that God sent “His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin.” This verse does not say “the flesh of sin”; it says “the likeness of the flesh of sin.” The other verse is John 3:14: “As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up.” The serpent lifted up on a pole in the wilderness was not actually a serpent with poison; it was a brass serpent made in the likeness of a real serpent (Num. 21:9). John 3:14 is the word of the Lord Jesus to Nicodemus. The Lord told him that as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must He Himself be lifted up on the cross. When Jesus was on the cross, in the eyes of God He was in the form, the likeness, of a serpent. But as was the case with the brass serpent in the wilderness, there was no poison in Him because He was not born of a fallen man. He was born of a virgin.\r\nNow we must clearly differentiate two points: Christ was conceived of the Holy Spirit and He was born of a virgin. His source was the Holy Spirit, and His element was divine. Through the virgin Mary as a means, He put on flesh and blood, the human nature, taking “the likeness of the flesh,” “the likeness of men” (Phil. 2:7). However, He did not have the sinful nature of the fallen flesh. He knew no sin (2 Cor. 5:21), and He had no sin (Heb. 4:15). He had flesh, but it was the “likeness of the flesh of sin.” In appearance He was made in the form of a fallen man, but in actuality there was no fallen nature within Him. His birth was exactly the same in principle. Apparently, He was the son of Joseph; actually, He was the son of Mary.\r\nWhy was the Lord Jesus viewed by God as being in the form of a serpent when He was on the cross? Because, since the day man fell (Gen. 3:1), the serpent had been in man, and he made every man a serpent. According to Matthew 3:7 and 23:33, both John the Baptist and the Lord Jesus called people the “generation of vipers,” that is, serpents, indicating that all fallen ones are descendants of the serpent. We all are little serpents. Do not think that you are good. Before you were saved, you were a serpent. This is the reason the Lord Jesus died on the cross to suffer God’s judgment. When Jesus was on the cross, He was not only a man, but was also in the form of a serpent. In the eyes of God, for all of us serpentine people, He took on the form of a serpent and died on the cross. Perhaps you have never heard that Jesus took the form of a serpent, the likeness of the flesh of sin. You have heard that Jesus is God and that He took the form of a man, but not that He also took the form of a serpent. How wonderful He is!\r\nWe are fallen flesh, and Jesus came into this flesh that He might bring God into humanity. In Him, the divine Person of God was mingled with humanity. The birth of Christ was not simply to produce a Savior, but also to bring God into man. Although humanity was fallen, God did not take on any part of this fallen nature. God took only the likeness of the fallen flesh, and through this He mingled Himself with humanity. We should not think of Jesus in the way many others think of Him. We must realize that Jesus is nothing less than God Himself mingled with fallen humanity, taking the form of humanity, but without man’s sinful nature. This was the birth of Christ.\r\n\r\n F. God Becoming Flesh\r\nHowever, it is difficult to find a verse which says that God became man. What the Bible says is this: “The Word was God...and the Word became flesh” (John 1:1, 14). Man is a good term, but flesh is not. If I tell you that you are a man, you will be happy. But if I say that you are flesh, you will not be happy because the word flesh is not a positive term.

We must realize that Jesus is nothing less than God Himself mingled with fallen humanity, taking the form of humanity, but without man’s sinful nature. This was the birth of Christ.\r\n\r\nTHE KING’S ANOINTING\r\n(1)\r\nMatthew 3:1—4:11 is concerned with the King’s anointing. This section of the Gospel of Matthew is in three parts: the King recommended (3:1-12), the King anointed (3:13-17), and the King tested (4:1-11). In this message and in the message following we shall deal with the recommendation of the King.\r\nI. RECOMMENDED\r\nA. The Recommender\r\nMatthew chapter three covers the recommendation and the anointing of the King. In this chapter firstly the recommender of the King, John the Baptist, is himself recommended. Matthew 3:1 says, “Now in those days John the Baptist came.”\r\n1. Born a Priest\r\nJohn the Baptist was born a priest (Luke 1:5, 13). In the life-study of Genesis we saw that the birthright included three items: the double portion of the land, the priesthood, and the kingship. Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn, should have received all three items of the birthright. However, due to his defilement, he lost the birthright. As a result, the double portion of the land went to Joseph, the priesthood, to Levi, and the kingship, to Judah. The main function of the priesthood is to bring the people to God, and the main function of the kingship is to bring God to the people. According to the Bible, the priests brought others to God so that they might obtain God’s blessing. This is the priestly service. The kings were those who represented God and brought God to others. Thus, the kingship is the ministry that brings God to other so that they may gain Him. Through this traffic of coming and going, man and God, God and man, have real fellowship, true communication. Eventually, man and God become one. This is the ministry of the priesthood and the kingship.\r\nThe first ministry in the Old Testament was the priesthood. Following the priesthood there was the kingship. All the books prior to 1 Samuel were on the priesthood. But beginning with 1 Samuel the second section of the Old Testament is on the kingship. In the book of 1 Samuel, Samuel represents the priesthood and David represents the kingship. Samuel, the priest, introduced David, the king. The priesthood introduces the kingship. It is the same in the church life today. If we are genuine priests, then we shall also become kings, for the priesthood always introduces the kingship. First we are priests bringing others into the presence of God. Then we become kings bringing God to them.\r\nEvery true evangelist is a king. If you are not a king, you are not qualified to preach the gospel. In 28:18 and 19 the Lord Jesus, the King of the kingdom, said, “All authority has been given unto me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and disciple all the nations.” Here the Lord told the disciples to go with His authority. Those who go with this authority are kings in the kingdom of heaven. Without doubt He shares this authority with us. Therefore, we must go and disciple the nations, that is, preach the gospel to subdue the rebellious ones. As we go to preach the gospel, we must be kings.\r\nMany Christians do not know God’s secret in His economy. When you are burdened to preach the gospel, you must first carry out the function of the priesthood. In order to preach the gospel you must first go to God as a priest and bring others to Him. Through the priesthood you will be authorized and anointed, and then you will come out of God’s presence to be a king. The proper preaching of the gospel is the issuing of a kingly edict. It is the utterance of a kingly command. Consider Peter’s preaching on the day of Pentecost. Although he was a young Galilean fisherman, he nonetheless was a king. Every proper evangelist must be a king.\r\nWe have seen that the priest introduces the king. The first occurrence of this was Samuel’s introduction of King David. In Matthew chapter three we see another Samuel, John the Baptist, who was born a priest of the tribe of Levi. Matthew 3 testifies to the consistency of the Bible, for here we see one from the priestly tribe, the tribe of Levi, recommending One from the kingly tribe, the tribe of Judah. In Matthew 3 John appeared as Samuel and Jesus appeared as David. There in the wilderness John was bringing people to God. Hence, he was a genuine priest. As he was bringing others to God, the King came, and John introduced Him. This King brought God to man. John brought others to God, and Jesus brought God to them.\r\nAs sinners we came to God through John’s ministry. By repentance we came into God’s presence. That was the ministry of the priesthood, the ministry of John the Baptist. We all have come into the presence of God through John. It was John who brought us back to God. Then the new King David, Jesus Christ, brought God to us. Through John’s ministry of repentance and Jesus’ ministry of imparting life, we have all been made priests and kings. Today we are the continuation both of the priest, John the Baptist, and of the King, Jesus Christ. If you are a proper Christian, then you are firstly today’s John and secondly today’s Jesus. Young people, as you go to the campuses, you must be real priests. You need to say, “Lord, have mercy on these people. O Lord, remember all these young people. I bring them to You.” This is the priesthood, the ministry of John the Baptist. After you bring others to God, immediately, in a sense, you will become Christ bringing God to them so that they may gain God. This is today’s priesthood and kingship.\r\n\r\n2. Forsaking the Outward\r\nPosition of the Priest\r\nAlthough John the Baptist was born a priest, he forsook the outward position of the priest. By the outward position of his birth he was not a real priest, but a priest in figure, a priest in shadow. In 3:1 John came preaching in the wilderness as the true priest. John the Baptist’s preaching was the initiation of God’s New Testament economy. He did his preaching not in the holy temple within the holy city, where the religious and cultured people worshipped God according to their scriptural ordinances, but in the wilderness, in a “wild” way, not keeping any old regulations. This indicates that the old way of the worship of God according to the Old Testament was repudiated and that a new way was about to be brought in. The wilderness here indicates that the new way of God’s New Testament economy is contrary to religion and culture. It also indicates that nothing old was left and that something new was about to be built up.\r\nThe dispensation of law was terminated by the coming of John the Baptist (11:13; Luke 16:16). Following the baptism of John, the preaching of the gospel of peace began (Acts 10:36-37). The preaching of John was the beginning of the gospel (Mark 1:1-5). Hence, the dispensation of grace began with John.\r\nNeither John, the new priest, nor Jesus, the new King, was in the old way. According to the old way, the priests stayed in the holy temple in the holy city, wore the priestly garments, ate the priestly food, and observed the priestly rituals. But with the coming of John the Baptist, all that was terminated. That was not the reality; it was a shadow. Now with John the Baptist, the genuine priest, reality came. As the real priest, John came to bring the people back to God. That was his ministry.\r\n3. Living in a Way\r\nContrary to Religion and Culture\r\nJohn fulfilled his ministry by living in a way that was absolutely contrary to religion and culture and outside both of them. Verse 4 says, “Now John himself had his garment of camel’s hair and a leather girdle about his loins; and his food was locusts and wild honey.” According to the regulations of the law, John, who was born a priest, should have worn the priestly garment, which was made mainly of fine linen (Exo. 28:4, 40-41; Lev. 6:10; Ezek. 44:17-18); and he should have eaten the priestly food, which was composed mainly of fine flour and the meat of the sacrifices offered to God by His people (Lev. 2:1-3; 6:6-18, 25-26; 7:31-34). However, John did altogether otherwise. He wore a garment of camel’s hair and a leather girdle, and he ate locusts and wild honey. All these things are uncivilized, uncultured, and not according to the religious regulations. For a priestly person to wear camel’s hair was an especially drastic blow to the religious mind, for the camel was considered unclean under the Levitical regulations (Lev. 11:4). In addition, John did not live in a civilized place, but in the wilderness (Luke 3:2). All this indicates that he had altogether abandoned the Old Testament dispensation, which had fallen into a kind of religion mixed with human culture. His intention was to introduce God’s New Testament economy, which is constituted solely of Christ and the Spirit of Life.\r\nWe have seen that during John’s time being a priest was a matter of religion, of wearing priestly robes, eating priestly food, and dwelling in a priestly building. When anyone conducted himself as a priest, everyone thought of him as a religious person, a person in religion. But here in Matthew 3 we see a real priest. Instead of staying in the priestly building, he went out to the wilderness, to a wild place where there was neither religion nor culture. There in the wilderness he lived in a “wild” way, eating locusts and wild honey. His honey was not the cultured honey processed and sold in stores today. It was wild honey. John was a real priest living in such a “wild” way. However, if you try to copy him, you will be false.\r\nJohn was truly outside religion and culture. He not only ate wild things, but he also wore camel’s hair. Notice that the Bible does not say that he wore camel’s fur, which would have been somewhat orderly, but camel’s hair, which certainly must have been messy. Furthermore, his leather girdle was probably not very refined. John was truly “wild.” Nevertheless this real priest was the recommender of the King.\r\nFrom the time of John the Baptist until today, a great many people have been brought back to God through the ministry of John. Whenever we tell others to repent, we should remember John the Baptist.\r\nThe ministry of John the Baptist was outside both religion and culture. When John was born, in Jerusalem there were two main things—Hebrew religion and Greco-Roman culture. John, however, did not stay in Jerusalem where his parents undoubtedly lived. He left Jerusalem and went out to the wilderness where there was neither religion nor culture, but where everything was natural. John ministered there in the wilderness bringing others to God and introducing the King, the One who represents God, to them. This was a strong indication that, during John’s time, the age was changed from the old dispensation to the new dispensation, from the dispensation of shadows and figures to the dispensation of reality. Those priests who wore the priestly robes, ate the priestly food, and stayed in the priestly building burning the incense and carrying out the priestly functions never brought anyone to God. But this “wild,” unreligious, uncultured John brought hundreds to Him. And he also introduced the King to them. This King was the One who brought God to repentant people.\r\nWhen this King was introduced to people and they were truly brought back to God, the kingdom was present immediately. The King with the people is the kingdom. The kingdom was there because both the King and the people were there. The New Testament begins with the genuine priesthood introducing the genuine kingship. The real priest introduced the real King. This introduction ushers in the kingdom.\r\nJohn’s message was, “Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near” (v. 2). People had to repent because the kingdom was coming and because the King was there. We also need to repent that the King may gain us and that we may be His people. After we repent, the King gains us, and we gain Him. Through the King’s gaining us and our gaining Him, we and the King become the kingdom. The kingdom immediately follows the King. If you receive the King and if He takes you as His people, the kingdom is immediately present. Why has the kingdom not yet come? Because you have not received the King, and the King has not yet gained you. Because you are still far away from Him, the King has not been able to gain you. Thus, the kingdom is not yet here. Rather, it is off somewhere waiting for your repentance. If you repent, the King will gain you, you will gain the King, and the kingdom will be here.\r\nMany Christians who are preaching the gospel today do not know the divine principles in God’s economy. If we would be real evangelists, real preachers of the gospel, we must firstly be John the Baptist. This means that we must be priests, not formal priests, priests in shadow, but genuine priests, priests in reality. After we become such priests, we must also be Jesus Christ. This means that we must be the King who brings God to others. When we go to God praying for others, we are priests bringing them to God. But when we come out of God’s presence and go to the people, we are kings bringing God to them. If we do this, they will repent to the King, the King will gain them, and the kingdom will be present.\r\nThe proper church life today is the kingdom. We all have repented, the King has gained us, and we have received Him. Now we are one with the King, and the kingdom is here with us. Hallelujah, the kingdom is here right now! All this depends upon the recommender.\r\nMy burden in this message is to emphasize the matter of the recommender. Are you today’s recommender of Christ? If you are, then you must be clear whether or not you are still in religion and culture. We must all be in the wilderness, in an environment that is “wild,” not in an environment that is religious or cultured. The proper environment is outside religion and culture, but it is full of the presence of God.\r\nWhen John was there in the wilderness, he was a great magnet drawing large numbers to himself. For this reason, verse 5 says, “Then Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the district of the Jordan went out to him.” Because of his drawing power, many came to John the Baptist. I hope the young people who go to the campuses will stand there as magnets. If you are such a magnet, others will flock to you. First you will be the priests appointed by God to bring others into His presence. Then you will be able to introduce the heavenly King to them. At that time, you will not only introduce the King to others; you will actually be the King. Thus, you will give a command to others, and many will turn to Christ. In this way Christ will gain the people, and they will gain Him. Then, immediately, the kingdom will appear on the campuses. This is the proper way to carry out the preaching of the gospel.\r\n\r\n B. The Place of Recommendation\r\nWe have seen that the place of recommendation was neither in the holy city nor in the holy temple, but in the wilderness. Verse 1 says that John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness, and verse 3 says, “For this is he who was spoken of through Isaiah the prophet, saying, A voice of one crying in the wilderness.” It was according to prophecy that John the Baptist began his ministry in the wilderness. This indicates that the introduction of God’s New Testament economy by John was not accidental, but planned and foretold by God through Isaiah the prophet. This implies that God intended His New Testament economy to begin in an absolutely new way.\r\nIf you trace the history of the past few centuries, you will see that every prevailing revival took place in some kind of “wilderness.” When John Wesley and George Whitefield were raised up as evangelists two centuries ago, they mainly did their preaching on the street corners. According to his biography, George Whitefield often preached on the foothills in the wilderness. However, at that time, the Church of England had regulations forbidding the expounding of the Holy Word outside the “sanctuary.” According to these regulations, anyone who preached or taught from the Bible had to do so in the “sanctuary.” Nevertheless, God raised up George Whitefield and John Wesley to conduct their preaching outside the “sanctuary.” The principle must be the same today. But this does not mean that we should copy John the Baptist in an outward way. It means that we should not take either the religious way or the cultural way. Rather, we must take the way that is full of the presence of God. We should not be in the holy city or in the holy temple, but in a place outside religion and culture, yet in a place full of the presence of God. I hope the young people will bring this matter to the Lord and pray, “Lord, make us today’s John the Baptist. Lord, take us into the wilderness and show us how to be genuine priests to bring others to You and how to introduce You to them as their King.”\r\nThe Gospel of Matthew is absolutely different from the Gospel of John. The Gospel of John is a book of life, whereas the Gospel of Matthew is a book of the kingdom. In John Jesus is life, but in Matthew He is the King. According to the book of Matthew, the Jesus we are to receive is the King. As we consider the Gospel of Matthew, we must be thoroughly and deeply impressed that we are now in the kingdom. Everything written in this book is related to the kingdom. Therefore, we must look into this book from the angle of the kingdom, viewing every chapter and even every verse from the perspective of the kingdom.\r\nThe repentance called for in chapter three is for the kingdom. You must repent because you are not in the kingdom, because you are not under God’s authority. You must repent because you have not yet submitted to the authority of Christ or come under His kingship. Although you may not feel that you are sinful, as long as you are not in the kingdom, you are a rebellious one. As long as you have nothing to do with the kingship of Christ, you are in rebellion and must repent. Repent of not being in the kingdom! The genuine Christians of today are saved, yet many of them still are not in the kingdom. Thus, even these Christians must repent. As long as you are not under the kingship of Christ, you must repent. If you are not actually in the kingdom of the heavens, not under the heavenly ruling, you must repent. It does not matter how spiritual, holy, or good you are. The only thing that matters is whether or not you are under the heavenly ruling. If you are not, it means that you are not in the kingdom and that you must repent. If you are not in the kingdom, you are in rebellion. You consider yourself scriptural, fundamental, and holy, but in actuality you are rebellious. Even your spirituality is a form of rebellion against the kingship of Christ. You care for your spirituality, not for the kingship of Christ. This indicates that you are in rebellion, that you are not in the kingdom. Repent of your rebellion! Repent of not being in the kingdom and of not being under the kingship and authority of Christ! This is the basic thought of the Gospel of Matthew.\r\nDo not think that Matthew is only for unbelievers, outsiders, or Gentiles. Many of us have never heard the Gospel of Matthew. I do not know what kind of gospel you have heard, but I do know that you need to hear the Gospel of Matthew, the Gospel of the kingdom that requires you to repent of not being under the kingship of Christ. We all must repent to the Lord and say, “Lord, forgive me. Even today I am still in rebellion. I am not under Your Lordship, Your authority, Your heavenly ruling. Lord, I confess that I have been ruled only by myself. Lord, grant me a true repentance for my rebellion, for my not being under Your authority.” We all need to repent. Praise the Lord that John the Baptist and this ministry of the priesthood are still with us! On the one hand, this priesthood brings us to God; on the other hand, it recommends the heavenly King who brings God to us. When we receive this King, He gains us, and the kingdom is here. This is the Gospel of Matthew.\r\n\r\nYou consider yourself scriptural, fundamental, and holy, but in actuality you are rebellious. Even your spirituality is a form of rebellion against the kingship of Christ. You care for your spirituality, not for the kingship of Christ. This indicates that you are in rebellion, that you are not in the kingdom. Repent of your rebellion! Repent of not being in the kingdom and of not being under the kingship and authority of Christ! This is the basic thought of the Gospel of Matthew.\r\n\r\nAs far as you are concerned, which title has the better meaning—the kingdom of Israel or the kingdom of Judah? I would surely favor the kingdom of Israel, for that is something universal, something for the majority. I would never favor Judah, because Judah is too local, too narrow. However, although the kingdom of Israel was more universal than that of Judah, in the genealogy of Christ, not one name of the kings of Israel is included. They were universal, but they were excluded from the generation of Christ. They were excluded because they were not associated with Christ.\r\nThis picture, like all other items in the Old Testament, was written for our learning, and it is a type of the occurrences in the New Testament age. We see the same thing today. In principle, at the beginning the church was one. But after a certain time, the church was divided, not into two parts, but perhaps into more than two thousand parts. Some may say, “Were not those in the kingdom of Israel still the people of God?” Certainly they were. They were the people of God, but they were outside of the line of Christ. What does this mean? To be outside of the line of Christ means that, although you are God’s people, you are not for Christ. You are for something other than Christ. Consider the situation today. We are all real Christians, and we are all God’s people. But are we solely, purely, fully, and ultimately for Christ or are we for something else? If you are for something other than Christ, then you are outside of the line of Christ. For this reason, none of the kings of the northern kingdom, the larger and more universal kingdom, is included in the genealogy of Christ.\r\n\r\nR. David the King Begetting Solomon\r\nMatthew 1:6 says, “David begot Solomon.” Compare this statement with the record that says, “Nathan, the son of David” (Luke 3:31). Nathan also was the son of David. The genealogy in Matthew says that the son of David was Solomon, and the genealogy in Luke says that the son of David was Nathan. If we read 1 Chronicles 3:1 and 5, we see that these are two different persons. Luke’s record is the genealogy of David’s son Nathan, who was Mary’s forefather, whereas Matthew’s record is the genealogy of David’s son Solomon, who was Joseph’s forefather. One genealogy is the line of Mary, the wife’s line; the other genealogy is the line of Joseph, the husband’s line. Both Mary and Joseph were descendants of David, but they were from two families descended from the same grandfather. One family is the family of Solomon; the other is the family of Nathan. Under God’s sovereignty Mary and Joseph, descendants of these two families, were betrothed and brought forth Christ. Christ may be counted as the descendant of David through both Solomon and Nathan. This is the reason He has two genealogies.\r\nSolomon’s relationship with Christ was not direct. Strictly speaking, Solomon was not a direct forefather of Christ. His relationship with Christ was indirect through his descendant Joseph’s marriage to Mary, of whom Christ was born (Matt. 1:16).\r\nThe Old Testament did not say that Christ would be Solomon’s descendant, but it prophesied repeatedly that Christ would be the descendant of David (2 Sam. 7:13-14, 16; Jer. 23:5). Although Christ was not a direct descendant of Solomon, the Old Testament prophecies concerning Christ were nevertheless fulfilled.\r\n\r\nVerse 11 says, “Josiah begot Jeconiah.” Compare this record with “the sons of Josiah...the second Jehoiakim...and the sons of Jehoiakim; Jeconiah his son” (1 Chron. 3:15-16). One generation—Jehoiakim—was omitted from the genealogy of Christ. This must have been because he was made king by Pharaoh of Egypt and collected tax for Pharaoh (2 Kings 23:34-35). Because he was so closely related to Egypt, he was excluded from the genealogy of Christ. Egypt represents the world. From these two records we see that anyone who is related to idols or associated with the world will be excluded from the generation of Christ.\r\n\r\nThose who were carried away to Babylon as captives (vv. 11-12) were indirectly related to Christ through their descendant Joseph’s marriage with Mary. Even these captives are included in this sacred record of Christ’s genealogy because they had an indirect relationship through Mary, the mother of Jesus.\r\n\r\nW. Jeconiah\r\nJeconiah was not reckoned as a king in this genealogy because he was born during the captivity and was carried away as a captive (2 Chron. 36:9-10, Jehoiachin is Jeconiah). According to the prophecy of Jeremiah 22:28-30, none of Jeconiah’s descendants would inherit the throne of David. All of his descendants were cut off from David’s throne. If Christ had been a direct descendant of Jeconiah, He would not have been entitled to the throne of David. Although Jeremiah 22:28-30 says that all the descendants of Jeconiah are excluded from the throne of David, the next chapter, verse 5, says that God will raise up a branch to David, a King who will reign and prosper. This Branch is Christ. This prophecy confirms that Christ will be the descendant of David, although not a direct descendant of Jeconiah, and will inherit the throne of David.\r\n\r\n Y. Zerubbabel\r\nEzra 5:1 and 2 say that Zerubbabel was one of the leaders who returned to Jerusalem from the captivity at Babylon. This means that he was a leader in the Lord’s recovery. This is a great thing. He was also a leader in the rebuilding of God’s temple (Zech. 4:7-10).\r\nWithout this return from captivity, it would have been impossible for Christ to be born at Bethlehem. The Old Testament definitely predicted that Christ, as the descendant of David, would be born in Bethlehem (Matt. 2:4-6; Micah 5:2). Suppose none of the people of Israel had returned to Judah, and the time came for Christ to be born at Bethlehem. No one would have been there. Now we can understand why God commanded the captives to return. God’s commandment that the captives return was not only for the rebuilding of the temple but also the preparation for Christ to be born in Bethlehem.\r\nIt is exactly the same today. Some may ask, “What is the difference between remaining at Babylon and returning to Jerusalem? Isn’t it the same, as long as we worship God and walk in the spirit?” It may be all right with you, but it is not all right with Christ. Christ needs some people to bring Him to Bethlehem. You may worship God and you may walk in the spirit in Babylon, but be assured that Christ could never be born into humanity through you. This requires a specific place. You must return from Babylon to Judah. When the time came for the Lord Jesus to be born, some Israelites, descendants of the returned captives, were waiting in Judah. At that time, Joseph and Mary were not in Babylon; they were in Judah. For Christ to come to earth, some of His captured people had to return. For His second coming, Christ also needs some of His captured people to return from their captivity to the proper church life.\r\n\r\nZ. Jacob Begetting Joseph\r\nThe genealogy here says, “Jacob begot Joseph” (v. 16), but Luke 3:23 says, “Joseph, the son of Heli.” Whose son was Joseph? Luke’s record says “as was supposed.” A literal translation would be “as to the law.” This indicates that Joseph was not actually the son of Heli, but was reckoned as his son according to the law. Joseph was the son-in-law of Heli, Mary’s father. This might have been a case according to Numbers 27:1-8 and 36:1-12, in which a regulation was made by God that if any parents had only daughters as heirs, their inheritance should go to the daughters; the daughters then must marry a man of their own tribe in order to keep their inheritance within that tribe. If we did not have Matthew chapter one we may wonder why such a record exists. Now we see that this is not merely the record of a certain regulation; it is a matter related to Christ, because the virgin daughter who brought forth Christ was such a case. We believe that Mary’s parents had no sons and that she inherited her parent’s heritage and married Joseph, a man of the same tribe, the tribe of Judah. Even the regulation in Numbers 27 and 36 is related to the genealogy of Christ. Either directly or indirectly the whole Bible is a record of Christ.\r\n\r\nAA. Joseph the Husband of Mary,\r\nof Whom Jesus Was Born\r\nAt this point, the record of this genealogy does not say “Joseph begot Jesus,” as mentioned of all the foregoing persons; it says, “Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus” (v. 16). Jesus was born of Mary, not of Joseph, since it was prophesied that Christ would be the seed of a woman and born of a virgin (Gen. 3:15; Isa. 7:14). Christ could not have been born of Joseph, because Joseph was a man and a descendant of Jeconiah, of whose descendants none could inherit the throne of David (Jer. 22:28-30). If Christ had been born of Joseph, he would have been excluded from the throne of David. However, Mary was a virgin (Luke 1:27) and a descendant of David (Luke 1:31-32), the right person of whom Christ should be born. The marriage of Joseph with Mary brought him into relationship with Christ and united into one the two lines of Christ’s genealogy for the bringing forth of Christ.\r\nNow we need to examine the chart (p. 52) which shows that the generation of Christ begins from God and continues until it reaches Jesus. The first name is God, and the last name is Jesus. It proceeds from God to Adam, from Adam to Abraham, from Abraham through Isaac and Jacob and on to David. After David, it is divided into two lines, the first running from Nathan to Mary and the second from Solomon to Joseph. Eventually, in God’s sovereignty, these two lines are brought together by the marriage of Mary to Joseph to bring forth Christ. If we spend time to consider this chart, we shall realize how wonderful is God’s sovereignty.\r\nAll marriages are under God’s sovereignty, especially marriages related to Christ. From God to David the genealogy was one line, and from David to Jesus it was two lines; yet these two lines were united through the marriage of Joseph and Mary. The Jesus who was brought forth by Mary fulfills the prophecies: the prophecy concerning the seed of woman (Gen. 3:15); the prophecy of a virgin bringing forth a son (Isa. 7:14); the prophecy of Abraham having a seed who would bring blessing to all the nations (Gen. 22:18); the prophecy to Isaac and Jacob, which was the same as the prophecy made to Abraham (Gen. 26:4; 28:14); the prophecy made to Judah that Judah would be the royal tribe (Gen. 49:10); and the prophecy made to David (2 Sam. 7:12-13). Although the birth of Jesus fulfilled many prophecies in the Old Testament, He was not the descendant of Jeconiah. Seemingly, the descendants of Jeconiah were still in the royal line. But according to God’s sovereignty, Mary, the mother of Jesus, married Joseph, a descendant of Jeconiah, who seemed to be in the line of the royal family. Apparently, Jesus was the descendant of Jeconiah; actually, He was not. He was the descendant of David. Only God can arrange such a thing. Praise Him!\r\nIf you consider your history, the history of your salvation, you will see that the principle is the same. Do not think that the marriage of Joseph and Mary was an accident. It was no accident; rather it was planned by the sovereign hand of God. Likewise, your association with Christ—your salvation—was not an accident; it also was planned by the divine hand. Sometimes I have thanked the Lord and said to Him, “I am so happy that You did not put me on earth in 20 B.C., but in the twentieth century. You put me on this earth in a place where the missionaries came with the Bible. One day I was born of a Christian mother. Later, I was given the opportunity to hear the gospel, and I was saved. Hallelujah!” This was no accident. Neither was your association with Christ an accident. God carefully planned it all. God has arranged all this for little people like us. This is not an insignificant matter. When we enter eternity, we may be very surprised. We may shout, “Praise the Lord!”\r\n\r\nDD. Abraham, David, and Mary\r\nAbraham, David, and Mary are three pleasant names in the Bible, names sweet to the ears of God (vv. 2, 6, 16). Abraham represents a life by faith, David represents a life under the dealing of the cross, and Mary represents a life of absolute surrender to the Lord. It was through these three kinds of lives that Christ was brought forth into humanity.\r\nThe principle is the same today. Consider the matter of preaching the gospel. The purpose of preaching the gospel is to bring Christ into humanity. This requires a great deal of faith, a life under the dealing of the cross, and a life of absolute surrender to the Lord. If we have these kinds of lives, we shall surely bring Christ into humanity.\r\n\r\nGG. Three Groups of Fourteen Generations\r\nVerse 17 mentions three groups of fourteen generations. The number fourteen is composed of ten plus four. Four signifies the creatures. In Revelation 4:6 we have the four living creatures, and in Revelation 7:1 we have “the four corners of the earth” and “the four winds.” The number ten signifies fullness. We often speak of one tenth, meaning the tenth part of fullness (see Gen. 14:20). Therefore, in Matthew 25:1 we have ten virgins. Look at your two hands and your feet: you have ten fingers and ten toes. Thus, the number ten denotes fullness, and the number fourteen signifies the creatures in full.\r\nThree times of fourteen generations indicates that the Triune God mingles Himself with the creatures in full. This is very meaningful. The Persons of the Triune God are the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. This genealogy is of three sections: the section of the fathers, the section of the kings, and the section of the civilians, including the captured ones and the recovered ones. God the Father fits into the section of the fathers, God the Son fits into the section of the kings, and God the Spirit fits into the section of the civilians. This is wonderful! Therefore, three times fourteen means the mingling of the Triune God with His creatures. This record of the generation of Christ indicates the mingling of the Triune God with these human creatures.\r\nThe Triune God has been traveling through Abraham and Isaac, Jacob and Judah, Boaz and Obed, Jesse and David, and then through many other generations to Mary and Joseph. Finally, Jesus came. Who is Jesus? Jesus is the Triune God traveling through all the generations and coming forth as the mingling of divinity with humanity.\r\nThree times fourteen is forty-two. Forty is the number of trials, temptations, and sufferings (Heb. 3:9; Matt. 4:2; 1 Kings 19:8). Christ is the forty-second generation. Forty-two signifies rest and satisfaction after trials. Numbers 33:5-48 shows us that the children of Israel traveled through forty-two stations before they came into Canaan. According to the record of the Old Testament, the Israelites suffered all the way through these forty-two stations. They were tried, they were tempted, and they were tested. They had no rest. However, after passing through these forty-two stations, they entered into rest. This not only happened in the past, but will happen again in the future. In Revelation 13, we see that there will be forty-two months, three and one-half years. These forty-two months will be the concluding part of the final seven years, the last week mentioned in Daniel 9:24-27. There are seventy weeks: the first seven weeks, then sixty-two weeks, and then the last week, each week representing seven years. The second half of these last seven years, a period of forty-two months, will be the great tribulation, and it will be awful. There will be many trials, testings, temptations, and sufferings. But, when these forty-two months have been completed, the kingdom will come and there will be rest. From Abraham through Mary was a time of sufferings, tests, and temptations. After all the generations of trials, temptations, and sufferings, Christ came as the forty-second generation to be our rest and satisfaction. With Him we have complete rest and full satisfaction.\r\nIf we read the history in Chronicles, we shall discover that the generations from Abraham to Christ were actually forty-five generations. Why then does Matthew have only forty-two? By deducting from the forty-five generations the three cursed generations and the one improper generation, and by making David two generations (one of the fathers and one of the kings), the generations become forty-two, which are divided into three ages of fourteen generations each.\r\nRemember: this is not only a life-study, but also a Bible study. Hence, we need some knowledge. We need to see that the record of Matthew is not a record according to history, but a record according to doctrine. The record of John, on the contrary, is according to history, for John wrote his Gospel according to the events of history. According to history, it was forty-five generations, but according to Matthew’s doctrinal purpose, it was forty-two generations. Matthew must have had a doctrinal purpose in saying that from Abraham to David was fourteen generations, from David to the carrying away was another fourteen generations, and from the carrying away to Christ was still another fourteen generations. It was not inaccurate for Matthew to say this. Three generations were omitted because they were not qualified, and a fourth generation was disqualified and cut off. But there was a wonderful person, David the king, who was doubly qualified. He became two generations, closing one section and opening another. He brought in the kingship, for through him the kingdom was established. Therefore, by David’s being counted as two generations, this genealogy of Christ can consist of forty-two generations in three sections, each with fourteen generations.\r\nHH. “To the Christ”\r\nLet us now consider the words “to the Christ” (v. 17). Luke’s record begins with Jesus and traces back to God, a total of seventy-seven generations. Matthew’s record proceeds from Abraham to Christ. Luke goes back and up to God; Matthew comes forward and down to Christ. All the generations were directed toward Christ and brought forth Christ. Without Christ, there are just forty-one generations; there is no goal, no consummation, and no conclusion. Forty-one is not a good number; we must have the number forty-two. Christ is the goal, the consummation, the conclusion, the completion, and the perfection of all the generations, fulfilling their prophecies, solving their problems, and meeting their needs. Christ came to fulfill all the prophecies, the prophecies of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Judah, and David. Without the coming of Christ, all these prophecies would have been in vain. When Christ comes, light, life, salvation, satisfaction, healing, freedom, rest, comfort, peace, and joy all come with Him. From this point on, the whole New Testament is the full expounding of this wonderful Christ. The twenty-seven books of the New Testament—the Gospels, the Acts, the Epistles, and Revelation—tell us how this Christ fulfills all the prophecies, solves all our problems, and meets all our needs and how He is everything to us. Hallelujah, Christ has come!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe genealogy in Matthew begins with Abraham, but the genealogy in Luke goes back to Adam. Matthew does not cover Adam and his descendants, but Luke does. What is the meaning of this difference? Luke is a book of God’s salvation, whereas Matthew is a book of the kingdom. God’s salvation is for the created and fallen race represented by Adam, but the kingdom of the heavens is only for God’s chosen people, the called race represented by Abraham. Therefore, Matthew starts from Abraham, but Luke traces the genealogy back to Adam.\r\n1. Called\r\nIn the first ten and a half chapters of Genesis God tried to work with the created race, but He did not get through. The created race failed Him. Man fell to such an extent that all mankind rebelled against God to the uttermost, and built the tower and city of Babel to express their rebellion (Gen. 11:1-9). So God gave up the created and fallen race, and He called one, Abraham, out of that race to be the father of another race. Out of a place filled with rebellion and idolatry, a place where everyone was one with Satan, God called a man named Abraham (Gen. 12:1-2; Heb. 11:8). From the time God called him out of Babel (later Babylon) into Canaan, God gave up the Adamic race and invested all His interest in this new race, with Abraham as its head. This is the called race, the transformed race. It is not a race according to nature, but a race according to faith.\r\nGod’s kingdom is for this race. It could never be with the fallen race. Thus, Matthew, dealing with the kingdom of the heavens, begins with Abraham, Because the book of Luke concerns God’s salvation (and surely salvation must be for the fallen race), his genealogy goes back to Adam. After being saved in Luke, we are spontaneously transferred from the fallen race to the called race. We used to be descendants of Adam; now we are descendants of Abraham. Galatians 3:7 and 29 tell us that whoever believes in Jesus Christ is a son of Abraham. Whose son are you? Are you the son of Adam or the son of Abraham? We are the real Jews (Rom. 2:29). Our grandfather is Abraham. We are in the same category he is. If we were not descendants of Abraham, then we would have no share in the book of Matthew. We would not even have a share in the short book of Galatians, because Galatians was written to the descendants of Abraham. Only if we are descendants of Abraham do we have a share in Galatians. Praise the Lord that we are the sons of Abraham! “If you are Christ’s, then you are Abraham’s seed, heirs according to promise” (Gal. 3:29).\r\nAbraham was called out by God. The Greek word for church, ecclesia, means “the called out ones.” Thus, we in the church are also the called out ones. Abraham was called out of Babel, the place of rebellion and idolatry, into the good land, which typifies Christ. We also were in Babel. We were fallen, we were rebellious, and we worshipped idols. Today the whole human race is in Babel. We used to be there, but one day God called us out and put us into Christ, the high land. We were called by God into “the fellowship [the participation] of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord” (1 Cor. 1:9). “To those who are called,...Christ, [is] God’s power and God’s wisdom” (1 Cor. 1:24).\r\n2. Justified by Faith\r\nAbraham, as a called one, was justified by faith (Gen. 15:6; Rom. 4:2-3). The fallen ones depend on their work, but the called ones believe in God’s work, not in their own work. No fallen person can be justified by works in the sight of God (Rom. 3:20). Therefore, the called ones, having been called by God out of the fallen race, put no trust in their own effort; they trust in God’s work of grace. Abraham and all other believers are like this. “They who are of faith are blessed with believing Abraham” (Gal. 3:9). The blessing of God’s promise, “the promise of the Spirit” (Gal. 3:14), is for the believing ones. By faith we received the Spirit, which is the reality and realization of Christ (Gal. 3:2). Thus, both Abraham and we are associated with Christ and joined to Him by faith. It is by faith in God’s work of grace that God’s called people are justified by Him and participate in Christ, their eternal portion.\r\n\r\n 3. Living by Faith\r\nHebrews 11:8 says that Abraham was called, and that he answered this call by faith. Then, verse 9 says that he also lived in the good land by faith. As the called one of God, not only was Abraham justified by faith, but he also lived by faith. As one called by God, he should no longer live and walk by himself, but live and walk by faith. For Abraham to live and walk by faith meant that he had to reject himself, to forget himself, to set himself aside, and to live by Someone else. Whatever he had by nature had to be set aside.\r\nIf we compare Genesis 11:31 and 12:1 with Acts 7:2-3, we see that when God called Abraham in Ur of the Chaldees, he was very weak. Abraham did not take the initiative to leave Babel; his father, Terah, did. This forced God to take away Abraham’s father. In Genesis 12:1 God called him again, telling him to leave not only his country and his kindred, but also his father’s house, which meant not to bring anyone with him. But once again Abraham, like us, was weak and he took Lot, his nephew (Gen. 12:5).\r\nWhat is an Abraham? An Abraham is a person who has been called out, who no longer lives and walks by himself, and who forsakes and forgets everything he has by nature. This is exactly the message of the book of Galatians. Galatians 3 says that we are the sons of Abraham and that we should live by faith, not by our works. Galatians 2:20 says that to live by faith means “no longer I who live, but Christ.” I, the natural I who came out of the fallen race, have been crucified and buried. Thus, it is no longer I, but Christ who lives in me. This is Abraham. If we are true Jews, the real descendants of Abraham, we must leave everything and live by faith. We must forget about all that we can do and repudiate all that we are and have by nature. This is not easy.\r\nChristians appreciate Abraham very much. However, we should not esteem Abraham too highly. He was not that outstanding. He was called, but he did not dare to leave Babel; his father took him out. This forced God to remove his father. Then Abraham relied on his nephew, Lot. After this, he put his trust in his servant, Eliezer (Gen. 15:2-4). It seemed that God was saying, “Abraham, I don’t like to see your father with you, I don’t like to see your nephew with you, and I don’t like to see Eliezer with you. I want you to have no one to rely upon. You must rely on Me. Don’t depend upon anything else or anything you have by nature.” This is believing in God, walking in Him, and living by Him. It is no longer I, but Christ who lives in me.\r\nIf we are real Jews, then we are real Abrahams. In order to be an Abraham, we must believe in the Lord. To believe in the Lord is to become associated with Him. Abraham was called out of the fallen race, and he became associated with the Lord. All the sons of Abraham must likewise be associated with Christ. “If ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed.” In other words, if we are the seed of Abraham, we belong to Christ and we are associated with Christ. If we would be associated with Christ, we must repudiate ourselves and take Christ as everything. This is believing in Christ, and this believing is righteousness in the eyes of God. Do not try to do anything. Simply believe in Christ.\r\nThe fallen race always likes to do something, to work and to exert some effort. But God says, “Come out of that. You are the called race. Don’t try, don’t do, and don’t work any more! Forget your past. Forget what you are, what you can do, and what you have. Forget everything, and put your full trust in Me. I am your good land. Live in Me, and live by Me.” These are the real Abrahams, the real Galatians. As the sons of God, they trust in God and forget about themselves. These are the ones who make up the generation of Christ. We all must be Abrahams, those who forget their past, give up what they are and have, and put their trust in Christ, their good land. Today our walk and our living must be by faith in Christ. If so, then, as heirs of God’s promise, as those who inherit the promise of the Spirit, we shall participate in Christ as God’s blessing.\r\nAt a certain time the Lord asked Abraham to offer Isaac, the one God had given according to His promise, for a burnt offering (Gen. 22:1-2). The Lord had given Isaac to Abraham; now Abraham had to give Isaac back to the Lord. The Lord had already charged him to cast out Ishmael (Gen. 21:10, 12); now He charged him to kill his son Isaac.\r\nAre you able to do this? What a difficult lesson this is! Nevertheless, this is the way to experience Christ. Last month or last week you may have experienced Christ in a certain way, but today the Lord says, “Consecrate that experience. That was a real experience of Christ, but don’t keep it.” Again, the lesson is to never trust in what we have, not even in what God has given us. If God has given you something, it must be given back to Him. This is the daily walk by faith. To walk in the presence of the Lord by faith means that we do not hold on to anything, not even to the things given by God. The best gifts, given by the Lord Himself, must be given back to Him. Do not keep anything as something to rely on; rely only and always on the Lord. Abraham did this. Eventually he lived and walked in the presence of God purely by faith.\r\n\r\n F. Jacob\r\nVerse 2 also says, “Isaac begot Jacob.” Isaac and Ishmael were brothers by the same father, but by different mothers. Jacob and Esau were more intimate; they were twins. Jacob means a superseder. He supersedes others, puts them under him, and climbs above them. When he and his older brother Esau were coming out of the womb, Jacob held Esau’s heel. Jacob seemed to be saying, “Esau, don’t go yet! Wait for me. Let me go first!” Jacob was a real heel-holder. The meaning of the name Jacob is the heel-holder, the supplanter. Beat others down. Put them under your feet by any deceitful means. That is Jacob.\r\nBecause God had already chosen Jacob, all his endeavors were in vain. Jacob needed a vision. He did not need to supplant others, because God had chosen him to be number one. Even before the twins were born, God had told the mother that the younger would be the first, and the elder would be second. It is written, “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated” (Mal. 1:2-3; Rom. 9:13).\r\nUnfortunately, Jacob did not realize this. If he had, he never would have tried to do anything. Rather, he would have said to Esau, “If you want to go out first, just go out. No matter how much you try to be first, I will still be first. You can never beat me because God elected me.” Jacob, however, did not know this. Even when he had grown up, he still did not realize it. Therefore, he was constantly supplanting. Wherever he went, he supplanted. He supplanted his brother (Gen. 25:29-33; 27:18-38), and he supplanted his uncle (Gen. 30:37—31:1). He schemed and he stole from his uncle, Laban. Yet, all his labor was in vain. God could say, “Stupid Jacob. You don’t need to do that. I will give you more than what you have gained.” But Jacob kept striving. Although he was a descendant of Abraham, according to his striving and his nature, he was altogether a descendant of the Devil. Do you see this? Positionally speaking, Jacob was a descendant of Abraham, but dispositionally speaking, he was a child of the Devil.\r\nWhat did Jacob need? He needed God’s dealing. Hence, God raised up his brother, Esau, and then his uncle, Laban, to deal with him. God even raised up four wives plus twelve male helpers and a female helper. There was a great deal of suffering in the life of Jacob, but this suffering came from his striving, not from God’s election. The more Jacob strove, the more he suffered. We may laugh at Jacob, but we are exactly the same as he. The more we try to do something, the more problems we have.\r\nIn Christ, we need, firstly, the life of Abraham. We need to forget what we are, live by Christ, and trust in Him. Secondly, in Christ we have no need of Ishmael, our doing; we need Isaac, His doing. Thirdly, we do not need Jacob, but Israel. We do not need the natural Jacob, but the transformed Israel, the prince of God.\r\nDo you realize that it is absolutely not up to you? When you hear this, you may say, “If it is not up to me, but completely up to God, then I’ll stop my seeking.” Good. If you can stop your seeking, I encourage you to do it. Tell the whole universe that you have heard that it is up to Him, and that you have stopped your seeking. If you can stop it, it should be stopped. But, I assure you, the more you stop, the better. The more you stop, the more He will stand up. Try it. Tell the Lord, “Lord, I stop my seeking!” The Lord would say, “That’s wonderful! Your stopping opens the door for Me to do something. I will burn you. You may stop your seeking, but I will burn you!”\r\nWe all have been elected. In a sense, we are caught. What can we do? We can never get away. This is absolutely due to the Lord’s mercy. We did not choose this way. I certainly did not choose it, but here I am. What can I do? What can I say? Because God has chosen us, we can never get away.\r\nIf we read Romans 9, we shall discover that it is up to Him, not us. He was and still is the source. Praise Him that His mercy has come to us! No one can reject His mercy. We may reject His doing, but we can never reject His mercy (Exo. 33:19; Rom. 9:15). What a mercy that we have been selected to be associated with Christ and to participate in Him as God’s eternal blessing! In one sense we are Abraham, in another sense we are Isaac, and in still another sense, we are Jacob. Later, in a fourth sense, we shall be Israel. Thus, we have Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.\r\nThe genealogy of Christ is a matter of the birthright, and the birthright is mainly the association with Christ and the participation in Christ. Jacob’s supplanting was not justified, but his seeking after the birthright surely was honored by God. Esau despised the birthright and sold it cheaply (Gen. 25:29-34). Thus, he lost it and was not able to get it back, even when he regretted and wept for it (Gen. 27:34-38; Heb. 12:16-17). He had lost the blessing of participating in Christ. This should be a warning to us. Jacob respected and sought the birthright, and he obtained it. He inherited God’s promised blessing, the blessing of Christ (Gen. 28:4, 14).\r\n\r\nAll Christians have been reborn as priests (Rev. 1:6). But today many have lost their priesthood. Because they have lost their praying position, it is hard for them to pray. If we would keep our priesthood, we must be like the Levites, and forget our father, our brothers, and our children and take care of God’s interest. God’s desire, not our families, must be first. If God’s desire has first place in our hearts, then we shall be close to Him and keep the priesthood.\r\n\r\nHebrews 12:16-17 warns us not to lose our birthright as Esau did. “For one meal” Esau “gave up his birthright.” Later, he regretted that he had sold it so cheaply, but he was not able to get it back. We all need to be on the alert. We have the position to possess the birthright and we have it already, but maintaining it depends on whether or not we keep ourselves from being profane or becoming defiled. We have seen that Esau lost his birthright because he was profane and that Reuben lost his birthright because of his defilement. But Joseph inherited the double portion of land because of his purity; Levi obtained the priesthood because of his absolute separation unto the Lord; and Judah received the kingship because of his care for his suffering brothers. We need to keep ourselves pure for the extra portion of the enjoyment of Christ; we need to separate ourselves absolutely to the Lord with a heart caring for the Lord’s desire above all things; we need to care lovingly for our suffering brothers. If we are like this, we shall surely keep our birthright. The extra portion of the enjoyment of Christ, the priesthood, and the kingship will be ours. Even today we can enjoy Christ in a double measure. We can pray, we can rule, and we can reign. Then, when the Lord Jesus returns, we shall be with Him enjoying the inheritance of this earth. We shall be priests contacting God continually and kings reigning over the people.\r\nBecause Judah gained the kingship portion of the birthright, he brought forth the kingly Christ (Gen. 49:10), Christ the Victor (Rev. 5:5; Gen. 49:8-9). “It is clearly evident that our Lord has risen out of Judah” (Heb. 7:14).\r\nAbraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Judah are all associates of Christ. If we have the life of these four generations—Abraham’s faith, Isaac’s inheritance, Jacob’s dealings, and Judah’s care of love—then we are the associates of Christ in His generation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTamar was the wife of the first son of Judah. This son should have inherited the birthright. But Tamar’s husband was wicked in the eyes of the Lord, and the Lord took his life (Gen. 38:7). The Lord also slew Judah’s second son (Gen. 38:8-10). According to the ancient regulations, Judah should have arranged for his next son to marry Tamar in order that a son might be brought forth to inherit the birthright. Judah, however, did not fulfill his responsibility. In a sense, Judah cheated Tamar (Gen. 38:11-14). But Tamar did not give up; rather, she even used an unseemly means to obtain the birthright. Whether the means was unseemly or not, Tamar did her best to get that birthright.\r\nTo have the birthright is simply to gain Christ. In order to gain Christ, we must be ready to take a way that does not seem to be the best way. Let me tell you a story that illustrates this, but try to understand me; do not misunderstand me. In the past, some young people in China were inspired by my preaching, believed in the Lord Jesus, and desired to be baptized. However, their parents, who were Buddhists, were very much opposed to this. When they learned that their children were planning to be baptized, they gave them no opportunity to leave home. The young people prayed about this. Eventually, they told their parents that they had to be in school for a certain half-day period. That was surely a lie, for they did not go to school; they went to the church to be baptized. Although they told a lie, it was a pure lie. Their intention in telling that lie was very pleasing to God. If you want to gain Christ, you should not care for the way. Do not be religious; do not keep the rules and regulations. Gain Christ! You need to gain Christ. By any means, get the birthright.\r\nIt was through an unseemly means that Tamar acquired the birthright. But in the divine record in the Bible, the name of Tamar is not a bad name. Ruth 4:12 indicates that this name is sacred. In this verse the elders said, “And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare unto Judah.” The name of Tamar is sacred because she did not care for anything sinful; she cared only for the birthright. The significance of this for us today is that if we care for Christ and are seeking Him, any way we can truly gain Him is the right way.\r\n\r\nK. Rahab\r\nWe proceed to Rahab (v. 5). Rahab was a harlot in Jericho (Josh. 2:1), a place cursed by God for eternity. Although she was a harlot in such a place, she became a grandmother of Christ. How could a harlot become a grandmother of Christ? In order to answer this question, we need to find the principles. The entire population of Jericho was destroyed except Rahab, her family, and her possessions. She was saved because she turned to God and God’s people (Josh. 6:22-23, 25; Heb. 11:31). After she turned to God and His people, she married Salmon, a leader in the army of the leading tribe of Judah and one of the men sent by Joshua to spy out Jericho. At that time, Salmon became acquainted with Rahab and, in a sense, saved her. Eventually, Rahab married him, and they brought forth a godly man named Boaz.\r\nNow we must pay our full attention to the principles governing our association with Christ. The first principle is that, no matter what our background is, we must turn to God and to God’s people. Second, we must marry the proper person, not in a physical sense, but in a spiritual sense. After we have turned to God and to God’s people, we must be joined, built up, and involved with the proper person. Third, we must bring forth the proper fruit. Then we will be fully in the portion of the birthright of Christ.\r\nIt seems that many Christians today have lost their birthright. They do not have Salmon and Boaz. If you would have a Salmon and a Boaz, you must become involved with the proper believers, with the proper leading ones in the leading tribes. Then you need to bring forth the proper fruit, Boaz, who will be a forefather of David. We must turn to the Lord, and we must turn to the Lord’s people; we must also take care of how we become involved with others. If we become involved with the proper persons, surely we shall bring forth the proper fruit. This will keep us in the full enjoyment of the birthright of Christ.\r\nL. Boaz\r\nIf we are to know the story of Boaz, we must read the book of Ruth. It is a good story. Boaz is a type of Christ, and Ruth is a type of the church. The book of Ruth tells us that Boaz redeemed Ruth; he also redeemed the birthright for her. This means that Christ, as our real Boaz, has redeemed both us and the birthright.\r\nBoaz redeemed his kinsman’s inheritance and married the man’s widow (Ruth 4:1-17); hence, he became a notable forefather of Christ, a great associate of Christ. As a brother and a Boaz, you should take care of others’ birthright of Christ, not only your own birthright. In other words, you should not only take care of your own enjoyment of Christ, but also others’ enjoyment of Christ.\r\nRuth was the daughter-in-law of Naomi. As we read this story, we see that Ruth and Naomi had lost the enjoyment, the birthright, but according to God’s regulation there was a way to restore the birthright, to redeem it. But it had to be redeemed by someone else. The principle is the same in the church life today. If I lose the birthright, the brothers have a way to redeem it for me. Quite often, some dear ones lose their enjoyment of Christ. In a sense, they become Naomi or Ruth. If so, you need to be a Boaz, able to redeem the lost birthright and marry the redeemed one.\r\nSuppose I am a real Ruth who has lost her husband. To lose the husband means to lose the enjoyment of the birthright. I have the birthright, but I have lost the enjoyment of the birthright. Thus, I need you, as my brother, to redeem my birthright. But you need to be somewhat richer in Christ. You need to have some riches with which to redeem my birthright. Then you pay the price to regain my birthright, and you also marry me. This means that you become involved with me. This kind of spiritual involvement will produce Obed, the grandfather of David. Boaz became one of the great forefathers of Christ. In a spiritual sense, he was the one who enjoyed the largest and richest portion of Christ. If a brother becomes a Boaz to me, he will be the one with the greatest enjoyment of Christ. Because he redeemed my birthright and became so involved with me, our involvement in the Lord will eventually bring forth the full enjoyment of Christ.\r\nIn the church life today we need to have a number of Boazes. The book of Ruth tells us that there was another kinsman who was even closer to Ruth than Boaz was. But that man was selfish; he only took care of his own birthright. He was afraid that taking care of another’s might mar his own. This is exactly today’s situation. Some brothers should take care of me, the poor Ruth, but they are selfish in the spiritual enjoyment of Christ. Even in the spiritual enjoyment of Christ it is quite possible to be selfish. However, a Boaz will be generous and pay the price to redeem my birthright. All this indicates that we should take care of not only our own birthright, but also others’ birthright. Day by day we should take care of others’ enjoyment of Christ. The more we do this, the better.\r\n\r\n P. The Wife of Uriah (Bathsheba)\r\nDavid murdered Uriah and took his wife, Bathsheba. She was the wife of a Hittite, a heathen (2 Sam. 11:3). She was remarried as a result of adultery (2 Sam. 11:26-27).\r\nQ. Solomon\r\nAfter David committed murder and adultery, he was rebuked by the prophet Nathan, whom God sent purposely to condemn him (2 Sam. 12:1-12). After he was condemned, David repented. Psalm 51 is David’s psalm of repentance. David repented and God forgave (2 Sam. 12:13). There was repentance and there was forgiveness. Altogether we have three items here: transgression, repentance, and forgiveness. If we put all three together, the result is Solomon. First there were transgression and repentance plus forgiveness. After that, there was Solomon (2 Sam. 12:24), the one who built God’s temple. Solomon is the result not only of transgression and repentance, but of transgression, repentance, and God’s forgiveness. Here we see two marriages. The first was a marriage between David and Bathsheba. The second was a spiritual marriage, the marriage of David’s transgression and repentance with God’s forgiveness. God’s forgiveness married David’s transgression and repentance. This marriage brought forth the man named Solomon who built the temple of God. The church is always built up by this kind of person, Solomon, the issue of man’s transgression and repentance plus God’s forgiveness.\r\nAfter David received God’s forgiveness and the joy of his salvation was restored, he prayed for Zion, for the building of the walls of Jerusalem, for the strengthening of his kingdom (Psa. 51:18). Eventually, as the result of God’s forgiveness of his sin, God gave him a son to build the temple of God for God’s presence as the center of the city of Jerusalem.\r\nI hope the Lord will show you what human words cannot say. If you have been and still are a typically good person who has never murdered others, who has never transgressed, and who has never needed to repent, then God does not need to forgive you. If this is the case, then there will never be a Solomon, and the temple of God will never be built up. As we have seen, the building up of God’s temple comes from man’s transgression and repentance plus God’s forgiveness.\r\nOne day I said to the Lord, “Lord, my transgression and repentance need Your forgiveness. But, Lord, You know better than I that Your forgiveness also needs my transgression. My transgression needs Your forgiveness, and Your forgiveness needs my transgression. If I have no transgressions, then You don’t have a place to spend Your forgiveness.” When I said this to the Lord, it seemed that He said, “Yes. Because of your transgression and repentance, I do have an opportunity to spend My forgiveness. I am happy about this.” But you should never say, “Let us do evil that good may come.” You must do your best. But no matter how hard you may try to do everything right in the eyes of the Lord, sooner or later something will happen. Suddenly, you will murder, take over others, transgress. However, after you transgress, there will be a way for you to repent. If you repent, God will be ready to forgive you. Then you will beget a son and name him Solomon. The name Solomon means “peaceful” (2 Sam. 12:24; 1 Chron. 22:9). But Solomon also has another name, “Jedidiah” (2 Sam. 12:25), which means “beloved of the Lord.” To you, Solomon means “peaceful,” but to the Lord, he means “beloved of the Lord.” This son will be the one who will build up the house of God, today’s church.\r\nYou need to be right in the eyes of God all the time. But be assured that your being right is not good for building up the church. However, you should not say, “Let me do wrong!” I tell you, even if you try to be wrong, you will discover that you are not able to do wrong. I do not know what kind of sovereignty this is. But one day you will do something awful. All the brothers will shake their heads, unable to believe that you could have done such a thing. Nevertheless, you have done it! Then you need to read Psalm 51, make it your psalm, and go to the Lord, saying, “Lord, I repent. Against Thee and only Thee have I done this evil thing. Forgive me.” After this repentance, you will have another marriage, the marriage of your transgression and repentance with God’s forgiveness. This will bring forth a Solomon, one who is peaceful to you and beloved of the Lord. This person will build up the church, God’s temple. At that time you will be very useful in the building up of the church.\r\nYou may say, “What about today? What shall we do—wait for that kind of person to come?” No, do not wait. Your waiting does not avail. We should just walk in the presence of the Lord and let the Lord do it. As Charles Wesley said in one of his hymns, “’Tis mercy all!” Yes, it is altogether a matter of God’s mercy. Forget about your background, your situation, or what may happen in the future. You simply need to trust in the Lord’s sovereign mercy. If you have a heart for Him and for His people, He will work everything out. He will give you the full enjoyment of the birthright of Christ.\r\nThese verses in the genealogy of Christ are very difficult. They are not milk or meat; they are bones. If we spend an hour or two praying over these verses and over the points covered in this message, we shall see something more. We shall see that we need to be a person with a real seeking heart, a heart seeking God and God’s people. Then we shall be today’s Boaz, Ruth, Obed, Jesse, David, and eventually today’s Solomon, building up the house of God.\r\n\r\nII. HIS BIRTH\r\nIn this message we come to the birth of Christ. Because the birth of Christ is altogether a mystery, it is difficult to talk about it. First, we need to consider some matters related to the preparation for Christ’s birth.\r\nA. By God’s Sovereignty\r\nThe birth of Christ was prepared and carried out by God’s sovereignty (1:18; Luke 1:26-27). By His sovereignty, God brought Joseph and Mary together in marriage to bring forth Christ to be the legal heir to the throne of David. Marriage is a mystery. It is not easy to bring two persons together, especially when it concerns the birth of Christ. It was not a simple matter to bring Joseph and Mary together. Look into the history here. According to the genealogy of Christ in Matthew, Joseph was a descendant of Zerubbabel, a returned captive. Zerubbabel, a leader of the tribe of Judah and a descendant of the royal family, led the captives from Babylon to Jerusalem (Ezra 2:2). Eventually, he also took the lead in rebuilding the temple (Ezra 3:8; 5:2). Joseph was his descendant. If there had been no return of the captives, where would Joseph have been born? He would have been born in Babylon. The same would have been true for Mary, also a descendant of the returned captives. If the forefathers of Joseph and Mary had remained in Babylon and if both Mary and Joseph themselves had been born there, how could Jesus have been born of Mary in Bethlehem? Now we can see God’s sovereignty in bringing back the forefathers of Joseph and Mary.\r\nBy His sovereignty, God placed both Joseph and Mary in the same city, Nazareth (Luke 1:26; 2:4). If they had lived far away from each other, it would have been difficult for them to come together in marriage. Joseph and Mary not only were descendants of the returned captives, but also lived in the same little town. This allowed them to come together in marriage.\r\nFurthermore, when we examine the genealogies in Matthew and Luke, we discover that Joseph was a descendant of the royal line, the line of Solomon (v. 6-7), and Mary was a descendant of the common line, the line of Nathan (Luke 3:31). Although Joseph and Mary came together in marriage, Jesus was born of Mary, not of Joseph. Apparently, He was born of Joseph; actually, He was born of Mary (1:16). This was absolutely a matter of God’s sovereignty.\r\nAs we have seen in a previous message, the curse recorded in Jeremiah disqualified any descendant of Jeconiah from inheriting the throne of David (Jer. 22:28-30). If, in actuality, Jesus had been born of Joseph, He would have been disqualified from the throne of David. Because Joseph was still in the royal line, he was a royal descendant according to man’s eyes. By the marriage of Mary, Jesus’ mother, with Joseph, Jesus was apparently associated with this royal line. Again, we see God’s sovereignty. God found a young woman, also the descendant of David, to bring forth Christ. Jesus was born of her and was actually the seed of David qualified to inherit the throne of David.\r\nBy this sovereign arrangement, Jesus was both an ordinary person and the heir of the royal throne. This is the reason He has two genealogies, one in Luke, telling us of His common status, and another in Matthew, telling us of His royal status. His common status came from Mary, and His royal status came from Joseph. Thus Jesus was born by God’s sovereignty. None of us was born under this kind of God’s sovereignty. None of us was born under this kind of sovereignty. Only Jesus was qualified to enjoy such a sovereign arrangement.\r\n\r\n B. Through Mary’s Surrender\r\nAccording to Luke 1:26-38, the birth of Christ was carried out through Mary’s surrender. Here I would say a word to the young people. It was not easy for a young virgin like Mary to accept the commission to conceive a child. If I had been she, I would have said, “Lord, if You would ask me to do anything other than this, I would do it. But You ask me to conceive a child! This is not humanly possible; it is neither moral nor ethical. I can’t do it!” For us to read this record is easy. However, suppose a young sister among us were to receive such a commission tonight. Could she accept it? This is not an insignificant matter. Mary might have said, “Gabriel, don’t you know that I am espoused to a man already? How can I conceive a child?” Who among us would accept such a commission? If an angel spoke such a word to you, could you accept it?\r\nAfter listening to the word of the angel, Mary said, “Behold the slave of the Lord; may it be to me according to your word” (Luke 1:38). This may appear simple, but the price was extremely high. To bring forth Christ Mary paid a very high price—the cost of her whole being. It is not easy to bring forth Christ; it is not cheap. If we would bring forth Christ, we must pay a price. Mary did.\r\nJoseph reacted immediately, planning that he would put Mary away secretly (v. 19). Thus, Mary was in trouble. I assure you, whenever you accept the commission to bring forth Christ, you will find yourself in trouble. All the angels will understand you, but not one human being will understand. Do not expect anyone to be like the angel Gabriel. Everyone will misunderstand you. In fact, the person closest to you may misunderstand you the most. Nevertheless, in large measure, the birth of Christ was accomplished through Mary’s surrender.\r\nC. Of the Holy Spirit’s Power\r\nHowever, Mary’s surrender was not directly related to the conceiving of Jesus. The conceiving of Jesus was directly related to the Holy Spirit (vv. 18, 20; Luke 1:35). Without the Holy Spirit, Mary’s surrender would have meant nothing. No matter how much we may surrender, without the power of the Holy Spirit our surrender means nothing. Do not estimate your surrender too highly. Our surrender means little; it simply affords the opportunity for the Holy Spirit’s power to come into us and accomplish something.\r\nD. With Joseph’s Obedience and Coordination\r\nAlthough there was the sovereignty of God, the surrender of Mary, and the power of the Holy Spirit, there was the need of Joseph’s obedience and coordination (vv. 19-21, 24-25). What would have happened if Joseph had insisted on a divorce? He was planning this. However, he was the person selected by God for the birth of Christ. Therefore, he was not so rough and quick; rather, he was considerate and thoughtful. Because at that time Joseph was a young man, I would take this opportunity to say a word to the young people: Do not make decisions too fast or act too quickly. Be a little slow and give the Lord a chance to come in. At least, give the matter another night. During that night, the angel may come and speak to you. This happened to Joseph. While he thought on these things, the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream (v. 20). Joseph obeyed the word of the angel.\r\nSuppose you were engaged to a young girl and discovered that she was with child. Would you still take her? To take such a woman would surely be a shame. Therefore, not only Mary paid a price, but Joseph also paid a price. The bringing forth of Christ cost him a great deal, for it caused him to suffer shame.\r\nThe points we have covered thus far in this message are merely some minor points. We come now to the major points.\r\nE. Fulfilling the Prophecies\r\nThe birth of Christ was a great fulfillment of prophecies in the Old Testament. The first prophecy in the Old Testament is Genesis 3:15. There are no prophecies in chapters one and two of Genesis, but in chapter three, after the fall of man, after the serpent had worked himself into man through the woman, God gave a promise. In giving this promise, God seemed to say, “Serpent, you came in through the woman. Now I shall deal with you by the seed of this woman.” Thus, the promise concerning the seed of the woman was the first prophecy in the Bible.\r\nIn 1:22 and 23 this promise is fulfilled by a virgin conceiving a child. This child came to be the seed of the woman. In Galatians 4:4 Paul says that Christ was born under the law and also was born of the woman. Christ came not only to fulfill the law, but also to fulfill the promise that the seed of the woman would bruise the head of the serpent.\r\nFrom Genesis we proceed to Isaiah 7:14, where there is another prophecy concerning Christ. “Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son.” The fulfillment of this promise brought God into man. Hallelujah, God became man!\r\n\r\n F. God Becoming Flesh\r\nHowever, it is difficult to find a verse which says that God became man. What the Bible says is this: “The Word was God...and the Word became flesh” (John 1:1, 14). Man is a good term, but flesh is not. If I tell you that you are a man, you will be happy. But if I say that you are flesh, you will not be happy because the word flesh is not a positive term. In 1 Timothy 3:16 Paul says, “Great is the mystery... Who was manifested in the flesh.” Although flesh is not a good term, the Bible says that God was manifest in the flesh.\r\nIt is not easy to understand what the Bible means by the flesh. In the Bible the flesh has at least three meanings. First, in a good sense, it means the meat of our body (John 6:55). Our body has meat and bone, blood and skin. This is physical. Second, flesh means our fallen body. God did not create fallen flesh; He created a body. When man fell, the poison of Satan was injected into his body, and the body was corrupted and became the flesh. Therefore, Romans 7:18 says, “For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, nothing good dwells.” This indicates that the fallen body, the body of sin (Rom. 6:6), is called the flesh. All human lusts come from this flesh. Hence, the New Testament has the term “the lusts of our flesh” (Eph. 2:3). Third, the flesh, especially in the New Testament, means the fallen man. Romans 3:20 says, “By the works of the law no flesh shall be justified before Him.” In this verse flesh is the fallen man.\r\nNevertheless John 1:14 says, “The Word [which was God] became flesh.” As we have seen, flesh means the fallen man. How, then, shall we interpret John 1:14? The Word was God, and the Word became flesh. Great is the mystery that God was manifest in the flesh. The Bible says that God became flesh and that flesh is not the created man, but the fallen man. Can we say that God became a fallen man? This surely is a difficult matter.\r\nHowever, there are two verses that can help us. The first verse is Romans 8:3, which says that God sent “His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin.” This verse does not say “the flesh of sin”; it says “the likeness of the flesh of sin.” The other verse is John 3:14: “As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up.” The serpent lifted up on a pole in the wilderness was not actually a serpent with poison; it was a brass serpent made in the likeness of a real serpent (Num. 21:9). John 3:14 is the word of the Lord Jesus to Nicodemus. The Lord told him that as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must He Himself be lifted up on the cross. When Jesus was on the cross, in the eyes of God He was in the form, the likeness, of a serpent. But as was the case with the brass serpent in the wilderness, there was no poison in Him because He was not born of a fallen man. He was born of a virgin.\r\nNow we must clearly differentiate two points: Christ was conceived of the Holy Spirit and He was born of a virgin. His source was the Holy Spirit, and His element was divine. Through the virgin Mary as a means, He put on flesh and blood, the human nature, taking “the likeness of the flesh,” “the likeness of men” (Phil. 2:7). However, He did not have the sinful nature of the fallen flesh. He knew no sin (2 Cor. 5:21), and He had no sin (Heb. 4:15). He had flesh, but it was the “likeness of the flesh of sin.” In appearance He was made in the form of a fallen man, but in actuality there was no fallen nature within Him. His birth was exactly the same in principle. Apparently, He was the son of Joseph; actually, He was the son of Mary.\r\nWhy was the Lord Jesus viewed by God as being in the form of a serpent when He was on the cross? Because, since the day man fell (Gen. 3:1), the serpent had been in man, and he made every man a serpent. According to Matthew 3:7 and 23:33, both John the Baptist and the Lord Jesus called people the “generation of vipers,” that is, serpents, indicating that all fallen ones are descendants of the serpent. We all are little serpents. Do not think that you are good. Before you were saved, you were a serpent. This is the reason the Lord Jesus died on the cross to suffer God’s judgment. When Jesus was on the cross, He was not only a man, but was also in the form of a serpent. In the eyes of God, for all of us serpentine people, He took on the form of a serpent and died on the cross. Perhaps you have never heard that Jesus took the form of a serpent, the likeness of the flesh of sin. You have heard that Jesus is God and that He took the form of a man, but not that He also took the form of a serpent. How wonderful He is!\r\nWe are fallen flesh, and Jesus came into this flesh that He might bring God into humanity. In Him, the divine Person of God was mingled with humanity. The birth of Christ was not simply to produce a Savior, but also to bring God into man. Although humanity was fallen, God did not take on any part of this fallen nature. God took only the likeness of the fallen flesh, and through this He mingled Himself with humanity. We should not think of Jesus in the way many others think of Him. We must realize that Jesus is nothing less than God Himself mingled with fallen humanity, taking the form of humanity, but without man’s sinful nature. This was the birth of Christ.\r\n\r\n F. God Becoming Flesh\r\nHowever, it is difficult to find a verse which says that God became man. What the Bible says is this: “The Word was God...and the Word became flesh” (John 1:1, 14). Man is a good term, but flesh is not. If I tell you that you are a man, you will be happy. But if I say that you are flesh, you will not be happy because the word flesh is not a positive term. In 1 Timothy 3:16 Paul says, “Great is the mystery... Who was manifested in the flesh.” Although flesh is not a good term, the Bible says that God was manifest in the flesh.\r\nIt is not easy to understand what the Bible means by the flesh. In the Bible the flesh has at least three meanings. First, in a good sense, it means the meat of our body (John 6:55). Our body has meat and bone, blood and skin. This is physical. Second, flesh means our fallen body. God did not create fallen flesh; He created a body. When man fell, the poison of Satan was injected into his body, and the body was corrupted and became the flesh. Therefore, Romans 7:18 says, “For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, nothing good dwells.” This indicates that the fallen body, the body of sin (Rom. 6:6), is called the flesh. All human lusts come from this flesh. Hence, the New Testament has the term “the lusts of our flesh” (Eph. 2:3). Third, the flesh, especially in the New Testament, means the fallen man. Romans 3:20 says, “By the works of the law no flesh shall be justified before Him.” In this verse flesh is the fallen man.\r\nNevertheless John 1:14 says, “The Word [which was God] became flesh.” As we have seen, flesh means the fallen man. How, then, shall we interpret John 1:14? The Word was God, and the Word became flesh. Great is the mystery that God was manifest in the flesh. The Bible says that God became flesh and that flesh is not the created man, but the fallen man. Can we say that God became a fallen man? This surely is a difficult matter.\r\nHowever, there are two verses that can help us. The first verse is Romans 8:3, which says that God sent “His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin.” This verse does not say “the flesh of sin”; it says “the likeness of the flesh of sin.” The other verse is John 3:14: “As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up.” The serpent lifted up on a pole in the wilderness was not actually a serpent with poison; it was a brass serpent made in the likeness of a real serpent (Num. 21:9).

We must realize that Jesus is nothing less than God Himself mingled with fallen humanity, taking the form of humanity, but without man’s sinful nature. This was the birth of Christ.\r\n\r\na. Found in Bethlehem by Pagan Men\r\nMatthew 1 reveals that Jesus, the Messiah, has come. If you had been an Israelite at that time, you would have said, “You tell me Jesus has come, but how can I find Him?” Thank the Lord that the matter of finding Jesus was not initiated by us: it was initiated by God.\r\nConsider the background. At the time of Jesus’ birth, there was a religion called Judaism. It was a fundamental, sound, scriptural religion that was formed, organized, and constituted according to the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament. Through the record of Matthew 2, we see that Judaism was very much for the Bible. However, hardly anyone in that religion knew that Christ had come. We find no record in the New Testament that some of those religious people went to find Christ. On the contrary, there is a record that some pagan men, magi, came to find Him (2:1-12). Of course, this was initiated by God, not by them.\r\n\r\n (1) LED BY THE STAR, THE HEAVENLY VISION\r\nGod gave the magi a shining star to guide them (2:2). This star did not appear in the Holy Land. It appeared to men far away—far away from the Holy Land; far away from the holy city; far away from the holy temple and the holy religion; far away from the holy Bible, the holy people, and the holy priests. Far away from all these holy things, the shining star appeared to some pagan men in a pagan land. The shining of that star stirred up these pagan wise men regarding the King of the Jews. I do not know how these wise men were stirred up regarding the King of the Jews, and I do not want to guess. There have already been too many imaginations concerning these wise men. At any rate, they came from the East, the Orient, and realized that the star indicated the King of the Jews.\r\nThe wise men had the living vision, the heavenly star, and the Jewish religionists had the Bible. Which do you prefer to have—the Bible or the star? It is best to have both. I like to have the Bible in my hand, and I like to see the star in the heavens. It is best to be both a pagan and a Jew as well. As to the Bible, I am a Jew; as to the star, I am a pagan wise man.\r\n(2) DISTRACTED BY THEIR HUMAN CONCEPT\r\nAfter the wise men experienced the vision of the heavenly star, they got into trouble. This trouble came from their natural concept. Although we may have the Bible and the star, we must recognize that trouble may come from our natural concept. The wise men saw the vision and, realizing that it indicated the King of the Jews, they assumed that they should go to Jerusalem, the capital of the Jewish nation, where the King of the Jews was presumed to be (vv. 1-2). Their decision to go to Jerusalem did not come from the light of the star. They went to Jerusalem because they were distracted from the right track by their natural concept. Jerusalem was the wrong place. It was the capital and the city where the temple was located, but it was not the place where Jesus was born. Because the wise men were misled, they caused a serious problem and nearly caused the young child Jesus to be killed. If it had not been for the sovereignty of God, the young Jesus would have been killed as a result of their mistake. Their error cost the lives of many young ones (vv. 16-18). Be careful: you may have the Bible and the star, but do not follow your natural concept.\r\n(3) CORRECTED BY THE SCRIPTURES\r\nMany times you have the vision, but when you consider the matter in your mind, you are distracted and misled by your natural concept. Your human concept distracts you from the right track. Whenever you are distracted like this, you need the Bible. After you have arrived at the wrong place, you need the right book. After the magi had gone to Jerusalem, the wrong place, they were corrected through the Scriptures. From the Scriptures they learned that the right place was Bethlehem, not Jerusalem (vv. 4-6). If they had not been misled by their natural concept, the star certainly would have led them directly to the place where Jesus was in Bethlehem. But they were distracted and went astray. Thus, they needed to be corrected by the knowledge of the Bible. When the magi had been corrected by the Scriptures, had departed from Jerusalem, and had been restored to the right track, the star appeared again (v. 9). Living vision always goes along with the Scriptures.\r\nHowever, none of the religious people in Jerusalem went with the magi to Bethlehem. This is quite strange. If you had been a priest among those priests, would you not have gone with the wise men to see if Jesus had actually been born in Bethlehem? If I had been there, I certainly would have gone to find out for myself whether or not Christ had actually been born. But none of them went. They had knowledge and they could tell people that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem; yet, none of them went for themselves. Although they were for the knowledge of the Bible, they were not for the living Person of the Messiah.\r\nHow about today’s situation? Many are very scriptural, but they care only for the Scriptures, not for the living Christ. If the Jewish religionists had cared for Christ, they would have gone to Bethlehem, which was not far from Jerusalem even by the ancient method of travel. Although Bethlehem was not far, none of the scribes, elders, or priests bothered to go. This proves that you can have the knowledge of the Bible without having a heart for the living Christ. To have the vision is one thing, to have the knowledge of the Bible is another thing, and to have a heart for the living Christ is still another thing. We all need to pray, “Lord, give me a heart for You. I want to see the vision and I want to know the Bible. But even more, I want to have a heart that seeks You.”\r\n\r\n (4) LED AGAIN BY THE STAR\r\nTO FIND AND WORSHIP CHRIST\r\nAfter the magi saw the star again, the star led them to the place where Christ was (vv. 9-10). The star led them not only to the city of Bethlehem, but to the exact spot where Jesus was.\r\nChristians often say that to know the Lord it is sufficient to have only the Bible. In a sense, I agree with this. However, in another sense—I say this carefully—I do not agree fully. Although we have the Bible, we still need a living vision. The Bible does say that Christ will be born in Bethlehem, but it does not say where, on what street, or in which house. The living star led the wise men to the city of Bethlehem and also to the exact street and the house where the child was. At that place, the star stopped (v. 9). The magi did not need to knock on any doors; they knew where Jesus was. This proves that we all need a clear, up-to-date vision that leads us directly to the place where Jesus is.\r\nThe magi not only found Christ; they also worshipped Him (v. 11). Among the Israelites, no one was allowed to receive worship from others. That was considered an insult to God, a blasphemy against Him. According to them, only God was worthy of people’s worship. But the wise men worshipped a child, and that child was God. Isaiah 9:6 says, “Unto us a child is born...and his name shall be called...The mighty God.” The child found by the magi was called the mighty God. The wise men worshipped Him and they offered to Him gold, frankincense, and myrrh (v. 11).\r\nWe need to know the meaning of the gold, the frankincense, and the myrrh. In the typology of the Bible, gold signifies the divine nature. This indicates that the child Jesus had the divine nature. He was divine. Frankincense signifies the fragrance of resurrection. According to our naturally religious mentality, the resurrection of Jesus came only after His death. However, before He died, Jesus told Mary and Martha that He was the resurrection and the life (John 11:25). Thus, even before He died, He was the resurrection. The life Christ lived on this earth was a life of resurrection. Luke 2:52 tells us that even in His childhood He found favor with God and man. That was not something natural; it was the life of resurrection. The record in Luke 2 reveals that the child was an extraordinary child. He was a unique child because He was a child in resurrection. In His entire human life and living there was the fragrance, the sweetness of resurrection. Death could not hold Him or even touch Him. Not only was He the life—He was resurrection.\r\nMyrrh signifies death and also the fragrance of death. Among the human race, death has no fragrance; however, with Jesus there was the fragrance of death.\r\nWhen the wise men presented the gold, the frankincense, and the myrrh, I do not believe they knew the meaning of the gifts they offered. They surely offered their gifts under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. They presented gold, frankincense, and myrrh, signifying that the child Jesus had the divine nature; that His life would be a life of resurrection, full of the fragrance of frankincense; and that His life would be full of the fragrance of death.\r\nWhen Jesus was twelve years old, He went to Jerusalem with His parents (Luke 2:42). Because He was burdened to see what people were doing in His Father’s house, the temple, He stayed in Jerusalem after the feast (Luke 2:43). Mary and Joseph did not understand Him. They looked for Him and eventually found Him in the temple (vv. 44-48). In a sense, Mary rebuked Him. If I had been Jesus, I would have rebuked her. I would have fought back and said, “Don’t you know what I’m doing here? Why do you come to bother Me?” If we read Luke’s account, we shall see that Jesus did say something to them. He said, “Did you not know that I must be in the things of My Father?” (v. 49). After He said this, He went along with them and returned with them to Nazareth. That was a real killing to Him. His intention was killed, and in that killing we can smell myrrh. That was not the fragrance of frankincense; it was the sweet aroma of myrrh.\r\nIf we read the four Gospels, the biographies of Jesus, we shall see that in the life of Jesus the gold, the frankincense, and the myrrh were very prevalent. He was always living the resurrection life, and He was constantly under the killing of the cross. He did not wait until thirty-three and a half years had passed before He went to the cross to be crucified. Throughout His whole life He was continually being crucified on the cross. Thus, He had not only the fragrance of resurrection, but also the sweet myrrh of the cross.\r\nThe wise men found the kingly child Jesus in Bethlehem, which Micah 5:2 tells us is “little among the thousands of Judah.” He was born in such a humble town in such lowly circumstances. However, due to the vision that came through the star, the wise men paid their full respect to the kingly child, not caring about the place. Therefore, they offered to Him the three precious items. Each of these items signifies some precious element of the Lord Jesus’ nature and life. In nearly every page of the four Gospels, we see the preciousness of the Lord’s humanity, the fragrance of His resurrection life, and the sweet aroma of His sacrificial death. Even in the early days, soon after the Lord’s birth, the wise men did such an appropriate thing. It exactly suited the Lord’s nature and life. Their offering was certainly presented under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit.\r\nIt may be that these precious treasures offered by the magi provided for the Lord’s trip from Judea to Egypt and from Egypt to Nazareth. The worship and offering of the wise men truly accomplished something.\r\n\r\n (5) WARNED BY GOD TO RETURN ANOTHER WAY\r\nAfter the wise men had found Christ, had worshipped Him, and had offered Him these precious treasures, they were warned by God to return another way (v. 12). This other way, not the original way, was the right way. Whenever we find Christ and meet Him, we are always told not to return to the original way. Finding Christ and meeting Him always turns us to another way.\r\nThe situation today is exactly the same. We have the Bible, and Christ is coming, but how shall we find Him? The basic principle is not with the Bible. Although the Bible helps, the basic principle is with the living star, the heavenly vision.\r\nNow we must see how we can have this star, how we can have this heavenly vision. The Bible tells us that the living star is Christ. It was prophesied that Christ would be the star (Num. 24:17), He came as the star (Matt. 2), and He remains as the star (Rev. 22:16). He is shining. How can we have Christ as the star? According to 2 Peter 1:19, the star is associated with the Bible. Peter tells us to take heed to the “prophetic word made more firm.” If we take heed to this sure word, something within us will dawn, and the daystar will arise in our hearts. To take heed to the sure word is to pay attention to the living Word. It is not just to read the Word; it is to enter into the Word until something arises within us. We may call this the dawn or the daystar. In 2 Peter 1:19 the daystar is actually the morning star. The word in Greek is phosphoros, a light-bearing substance. A piece of phosphorus can shine in darkness. Christ is the real phosphorus shining in today’s darkness. However, the Word cannot shine over you unless you take heed to it. You must take heed until something begins to shine within you. That shining will become the phosphorus in your heart. Then you will have the daystar. You will be like the wise men, and something from the heavens will shine over you.\r\nChrist is the star. The Bible says that the followers of Christ are stars also. Revelation 1:20 tells us that all the leading ones in the proper church life are stars. They are stars because they are the shining ones. Daniel 12:3 says that the righteous will shine like stars. Those who turn others to righteousness, who turn them from the wrong way to the right way, will shine like stars.\r\nToday there are only two ways to have the star shining over you. According to the first way, you must come to the sure Word and open up your whole being to the Word— your mouth, your eyes, your mind, your spirit, and your heart—until something rises up in you and shines over you. That is Christ. The second way is to come to the shining saints, the followers of Christ. If you come to them, you will receive light. You also will receive some leading, for they will lead you to the place where Christ is.\r\nBoth ways of having the star are linked to the Spirit and the church. Immediately after Revelation 22:16, which says that the Lord Jesus is the morning star, the following verse says, “And the Spirit and the bride say....” This proves that, as the morning star, the Lord Jesus is linked to the Spirit and to the church, which is the Bride. Revelation 3:1 says that the Lord Jesus has the seven Spirits and the seven stars, and Revelation 1:20 says that the seven stars are the angels of the churches. These verses show that the stars are linked not only to the Spirit, but also to the churches. If we would have the living star or the living stars, we need the Spirit and the church. By the Spirit and through the church, it will be easy to have the heavenly vision so that we may find Christ and render our appreciation to Him.\r\nb. Fleeing to Egypt\r\nChrist was found in Bethlehem. This discovery of Christ created trouble. God used this trouble to bring the young child out of Bethlehem to Egypt (Matt. 2:13-18). Hosea 11:1 prophesied that Jesus would be called out of Egypt. Without the trouble that occurred after Jesus was found in Bethlehem, there would have been no occasion for Him to flee to Egypt.\r\nThis is very meaningful. The wise men made a great mistake, but their mistake offered God the opportunity to fulfill His prophecy. But do not make mistakes purposely. That will not work. Try your best to do things right. Nevertheless, no matter how hard you try to be right, eventually you will make as big a mistake as the wise men did. Never say, “Let us do evil, that good may come.” If you do evil, good will not come. However, if you try to be right but still make a mistake, that mistake will offer God a chance to fulfill His purpose.\r\nBecause Joseph fled with Mary and Jesus into Egypt, the young child Jesus escaped the first martyrdom, the martyrdom caused by the mistake of the wise men. Satan is always busy, waiting for an opportunity to cause martyrdom. However, God is sovereign over all, even over Satan, to preserve His dear ones from the enemy’s wiles. By God’s sovereignty the young Jesus was preserved.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
